# 0.2 — Mathematical Prerequisites

Before diving into probability theory, we need to establish the mathematical foundations. This lesson reviews essential concepts from set theory and combinatorics that we'll use throughout the series.

## Set Theory Basics

A **set** is a collection of distinct objects. Sets are fundamental to probability because events are sets of outcomes. Learn more: [Set Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory)

### Set Notation

- **Elements**: Objects in a set are called elements
- **Membership**: $a \in A$ means "a is an element of set A"
- **Empty Set**: $\emptyset$ or $\{\}$ is the set with no elements
- **Universal Set**: $\Omega$ (omega) is the set of all possible outcomes

### Set Operations

**Union** ($A \cup B$): All elements in A or B (or both)

$$\{1, 2, 3\} \cup \{3, 4, 5\} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$$

**Intersection** ($A \cap B$): Elements in both A and B

$$\{1, 2, 3\} \cap \{3, 4, 5\} = \{3\}$$

**Complement** ($A^c$ or $\bar{A}$): All elements not in A (relative to universal set)

If $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and $A = \{1, 2\}$, then:

$$A^c = \{3, 4, 5\}$$

**Difference** ($A \setminus B$): Elements in A but not in B

$$\{1, 2, 3\} \setminus \{3, 4\} = \{1, 2\}$$

### Set Properties

- **Disjoint Sets**: $A \cap B = \emptyset$ (no common elements)
- **Subset**: $A \subseteq B$ means all elements of A are in B
- **Cardinality**: $|A|$ is the number of elements in set A

## Combinatorics

**Combinatorics** is the study of counting arrangements and selections. It's essential for calculating probabilities in discrete settings. Learn more: [Combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics)

### Multiplication Principle

If you can do task A in $m$ ways and task B in $n$ ways, you can do both in $m \times n$ ways.

**Example**: If you have 3 shirts and 4 pants, you have $3 \times 4 = 12$ outfits.

### Permutations

A **permutation** is an ordered arrangement of objects. Learn more: [Permutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation)

**Permutations of n distinct objects**: $n! = n \times (n-1) \times ... \times 2 \times 1$

$$5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$$

**Permutations of r objects from n**: $P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$

$$P(5, 3) = \frac{5!}{2!} = 60$$

### Combinations

A **combination** is an unordered selection of objects (order doesn't matter). Learn more: [Combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination)

**Combinations of r objects from n**: $C(n, r) = \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$

$$\binom{10}{3} = \frac{10!}{3!7!} = 120$$

**Key Formula**: $\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n}{n-r}$ (choosing r is same as excluding n-r)

### Binomial Theorem

$$(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$$

This will be important when we study the binomial distribution! Learn more: [Binomial Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_theorem)

## Summation and Product Notation

**Summation** ($\sum$): $\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n$

**Product** ($\prod$): $\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i = x_1 \times x_2 \times ... \times x_n$

**Key Formulas**:
- $\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$
- $\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$

## Functions and Limits

### Functions

A **function** $f: A \to B$ maps each element of set A to an element of set B.

- **Domain**: Set A (inputs)
- **Range/Codomain**: Set B (outputs)

### Limits

The **limit** of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is $L$: $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$. Learn more: [Limit (Mathematics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics))

Important for continuous probability distributions!

### Continuity

A function is **continuous** if small changes in input cause small changes in output. Probability density functions are continuous.

## Basic Calculus

### Derivatives

The **derivative** $f'(x)$ measures the rate of change:

$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$

Learn more: [Derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative)

**Common Derivatives**:
- $(x^n)' = nx^{n-1}$
- $(e^x)' = e^x$
- $(\ln x)' = \frac{1}{x}$

### Integrals

The **integral** $\int_a^b f(x) dx$ measures the area under the curve. Learn more: [Integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral)

**Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: $\int_a^b f'(x) dx = f(b) - f(a)$. Learn more: [Fundamental Theorem of Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus)

**Common Integrals**:

$$\int x^n dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C \quad \text{where } n \neq -1$$

$$\int e^x dx = e^x + C$$

$$\int \frac{1}{x} dx = \ln|x| + C$$

## Series

### Geometric Series

For $|r| < 1$: $\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} r^i = \frac{1}{1-r}$

For finite: $\sum_{i=0}^{n} r^i = \frac{1-r^{n+1}}{1-r}$

Learn more: [Geometric Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series)

### Taylor Series

$f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$

Important for moment generating functions! Learn more: [Taylor Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series)

## Why This Matters

These mathematical tools are essential because:

- **Set Theory**: Events in probability are sets of outcomes
- **Combinatorics**: Counts outcomes in discrete probability
- **Calculus**: Needed for continuous distributions and expectations
- **Series**: Used in moment generating functions and infinite sums

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll set up Python and the scientific computing libraries (NumPy, SciPy) that we'll use throughout this series to implement probability concepts.
