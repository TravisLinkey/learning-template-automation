# 1.x — Chapter 1 summary and quiz

## Chapter summary

In this chapter, we covered the fundamental concepts of basic probability theory:

### Key concepts

- **Sample Space** ($\Omega$): The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment - [Sample Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_space)
- **Event**: A subset of the sample space - [Event (Probability Theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(probability_theory))
- **Probability**: A number between 0 and 1 quantifying how likely an event is to occur - [Probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability)
- **Independence**: Events that don't affect each other's probabilities - [Independence (Probability Theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory))
- **Dependence**: Events that influence each other's probabilities

### What we learned

1. **Sample Spaces and Events (1.1)**:
   - Discrete vs. continuous sample spaces
   - Simple events (single outcome) vs. compound events (multiple outcomes)
   - Set operations: union ($\cup$), intersection ($\cap$), complement ($^c$)
   - Mutually exclusive events (cannot occur simultaneously)

2. **Probability Axioms and Rules (1.2)**:
   - **Axiom 1**: Non-negativity: $P(A) \geq 0$
   - **Axiom 2**: Normalization: $P(\Omega) = 1$
   - **Axiom 3**: Additivity: For mutually exclusive events, $P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup ...) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + ...$
   - Complement rule: $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$
   - Addition rule: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
   - Equally likely outcomes: $P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$

3. **Independence and Dependence (1.3)**:
   - Events $A$ and $B$ are independent if $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$
   - Equivalently, $P(B | A) = P(B)$ for independent events
   - Conditional probability: $P(B | A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$
   - In finance, events are often dependent (correlated)

### Applications in quantitative finance

- **Portfolio Analysis**: Sample spaces for returns, events for risk scenarios
- **Risk Management**: Probability of losses, joint risk events
- **Trading Signals**: Independent vs. dependent signals
- **Market Conditions**: Dependence between market variables

### Important formulas

| Concept | Formula |
|---------|---------|
| Complement | $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$ |
| Union (general) | $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$ |
| Union (mutually exclusive) | $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$ |
| Independence | $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$ |
| Conditional Probability | $P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$ |
| Equally Likely | $P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$ |

### Next steps

In Chapter 2, we'll explore **conditional probability** in more depth, including how to update probabilities when new information becomes available. This leads to [**Bayes' Theorem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem), which is fundamental for decision-making under uncertainty in quantitative finance.

## Quiz time

**Question #1**

A fair die is rolled. Define the following events:
- $A$ = "Roll an even number"
- $B$ = "Roll a number greater than 4"
- $C$ = "Roll a 6"

What are the sets for events $A$, $B$, and $C$? What is $A \cap B$?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

- $A = \{2, 4, 6\}$ (even numbers)
- $B = \{5, 6\}$ (numbers greater than 4)
- $C = \{6\}$ (simple event)

$A \cap B = \{6\}$ (numbers that are both even AND greater than 4)

</details>

**Question #2**

Using the events from Question #1, calculate:
- $P(A)$
- $P(B)$
- $P(A \cup B)$
- $P(A \cap B)$

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

Since all outcomes are equally likely:

- $P(A) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$ (3 even numbers out of 6)
- $P(B) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$ (2 numbers > 4 out of 6)
- $P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{6}$ (only 6 is in both)

Using the addition rule:
$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$$

Alternatively, we can count: $A \cup B = \{2, 4, 5, 6\}$, so $P(A \cup B) = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$.

</details>

**Question #3**

Two fair coins are tossed. Let:
- $A$ = "First coin is heads"
- $B$ = "Second coin is heads"

Are events $A$ and $B$ independent? Justify your answer.

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

Yes, $A$ and $B$ are independent.

**Method 1: Check definition**
- $P(A) = \frac{1}{2}$
- $P(B) = \frac{1}{2}$
- $P(A \cap B) = P(\text{both heads}) = \frac{1}{4}$

Since $P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = P(A) \cdot P(B)$, the events are independent.

**Method 2: Check conditional probability**
- $P(B | A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)} = \frac{1/4}{1/2} = \frac{1}{2} = P(B)$

Since $P(B | A) = P(B)$, the events are independent.

**Intuition**: The outcome of the first coin toss doesn't affect the second coin toss.

**Question #4**

A portfolio has three possible outcomes:
- High return: probability 0.4
- Medium return: probability 0.35
- Low return: probability 0.25

What is the probability of NOT getting a low return? What is the probability of getting either a high or medium return?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

Let $L$ = "Low return", so $P(L) = 0.25$.

Using the complement rule:
$$P(L^c) = 1 - P(L) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$$

The probability of NOT getting a low return is 0.75.

For the second part, let $H$ = "High return" and $M$ = "Medium return". Since these are mutually exclusive events:
$$P(H \cup M) = P(H) + P(M) = 0.4 + 0.35 = 0.75$$

Note that $P(H \cup M) = P(L^c)$, which makes sense since high and medium are the complement of low.

</details>

**Question #5**

Two stocks have the following probabilities:
- Stock 1 goes up: $P(A) = 0.6$
- Stock 2 goes up: $P(B) = 0.5$
- Both go up: $P(A \cap B) = 0.4$

Are the stock movements independent? What is the probability that at least one stock goes up?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

**Check independence:**

If independent: $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) = 0.6 \cdot 0.5 = 0.3$

Actual: $P(A \cap B) = 0.4 \neq 0.3$

Since $0.4 \neq 0.3$, the events are **dependent** (correlated). The stocks tend to move together more than if they were independent.

**Probability of at least one going up:**

Using the addition rule:
$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = 0.6 + 0.5 - 0.4 = 0.7$$

The probability that at least one stock goes up is 0.7.

</details>

**Question #6**

A trading strategy has a 60% win rate. If we assume each trade is independent, what is the probability of:
- Winning the first trade?
- Losing the first trade?
- Winning both the first and second trades?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

Let $W$ = "Win a trade", so $P(W) = 0.6$ and $P(W^c) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4$.

- **First trade win**: $P(W) = 0.6$
- **First trade loss**: $P(W^c) = 0.4$

Since trades are independent:
- **Both trades win**: $P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1) \cdot P(W_2) = 0.6 \cdot 0.6 = 0.36$

The probability of winning both trades is 0.36 (36%).

</details>

**Question #7**

Write Python code to:
1. Check if two events are independent given their probabilities
2. Calculate the probability of the union of two events
3. Calculate the probability of the complement of an event

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

```python
def are_independent(p_a, p_b, p_intersection, tolerance=1e-6):
    """Check if events A and B are independent"""
    expected = p_a * p_b
    return abs(p_intersection - expected) < tolerance

def probability_union(p_a, p_b, p_intersection):
    """Calculate P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)"""
    return p_a + p_b - p_intersection

def probability_complement(p_a):
    """Calculate P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)"""
    return 1 - p_a

# Example usage
p_a = 0.6
p_b = 0.5
p_intersection = 0.4

print(f"Are independent? {are_independent(p_a, p_b, p_intersection)}")
print(f"P(A ∪ B) = {probability_union(p_a, p_b, p_intersection):.2f}")
print(f"P(A^c) = {probability_complement(p_a):.2f}")
```

Output:
```
Are independent? False
P(A ∪ B) = 0.70
P(A^c) = 0.40
```
