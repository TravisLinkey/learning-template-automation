# 1.3 — Independence and Dependence

Understanding whether events are **independent** or **dependent** is crucial in quantitative finance. This lesson explains these concepts and how to identify and work with independent and dependent events.

## What is Independence?

Two events $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. Learn more: [Independence (Probability Theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory))

**Mathematical Definition:**

Events $A$ and $B$ are independent if and only if:

$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$$

**Intuitive Meaning:** Knowing that $A$ occurred doesn't change the probability of $B$ occurring, and vice versa.

## What is Dependence?

Two events $A$ and $B$ are **dependent** if they are not independent. The occurrence of one affects the probability of the other.

**Mathematical Definition:**

Events $A$ and $B$ are dependent if:

$$P(A \cap B) \neq P(A) \cdot P(B)$$

## Examples of Independence

### Example 1: Coin Tosses

Two fair coin tosses are independent:
- $A$ = "First toss is heads": $P(A) = \frac{1}{2}$
- $B$ = "Second toss is heads": $P(B) = \frac{1}{2}$
- $P(A \cap B) = P(\text{both heads}) = \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = P(A) \cdot P(B)$ ✓

**Interpretation:** The outcome of the first toss doesn't affect the second toss.

### Example 2: Die Rolls

Two fair die rolls are independent:
- $A$ = "First die shows 6": $P(A) = \frac{1}{6}$
- $B$ = "Second die shows 6": $P(B) = \frac{1}{6}$
- $P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} = P(A) \cdot P(B)$ ✓

### Example 3: Independent Stock Returns

If two stocks have independent returns:
- $A$ = "Stock 1 goes up": $P(A) = 0.6$
- $B$ = "Stock 2 goes up": $P(B) = 0.5$
- $P(A \cap B) = 0.6 \cdot 0.5 = 0.3$ (if independent)

## Examples of Dependence

### Example 1: Drawing Cards Without Replacement

Drawing two cards from a deck without replacement:
- $A$ = "First card is an ace": $P(A) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}$
- $B$ = "Second card is an ace": $P(B) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}$ (before first draw)
- But $P(B | A) = \frac{3}{51}$ (after drawing first ace)
- $P(A \cap B) = \frac{4}{52} \cdot \frac{3}{51} = \frac{12}{2652} \neq \frac{1}{13} \cdot \frac{1}{13}$ ✗

**Interpretation:** Drawing the first ace changes the probability of drawing a second ace.

### Example 2: Market Conditions

Market conditions can create dependence:
- $A$ = "Stock A goes up": $P(A) = 0.6$
- $B$ = "Stock B goes up": $P(B) = 0.5$
- If stocks are in the same sector: $P(A \cap B) = 0.4 > 0.6 \cdot 0.5 = 0.3$ ✗

**Interpretation:** When stocks are correlated, they tend to move together.

### Example 3: Portfolio Risk

- $A$ = "Asset 1 defaults": $P(A) = 0.01$
- $B$ = "Asset 2 defaults": $P(B) = 0.01$
- If assets are correlated: $P(A \cap B) = 0.0005 > 0.01 \cdot 0.01 = 0.0001$ ✗

**Interpretation:** Correlated defaults increase the probability of joint defaults.

## Conditional Probability and Independence

**Conditional Probability** is the probability of event $B$ given that event $A$ has occurred:

$$P(B | A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$$

Learn more: [Conditional Probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability)

**Key Relationship:** Events $A$ and $B$ are independent if and only if:

$$P(B | A) = P(B)$$

**Interpretation:** If $A$ and $B$ are independent, knowing $A$ occurred doesn't change the probability of $B$.

### Example

**Independent Events:**
- $A$ = "First coin is heads": $P(A) = \frac{1}{2}$
- $B$ = "Second coin is heads": $P(B) = \frac{1}{2}$
- $P(B | A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)} = \frac{1/4}{1/2} = \frac{1}{2} = P(B)$ ✓

**Dependent Events (Cards):**
- $A$ = "First card is ace": $P(A) = \frac{4}{52}$
- $B$ = "Second card is ace"
- $P(B | A) = \frac{3}{51} \neq P(B) = \frac{4}{52}$ ✗

## Independence of Multiple Events

For three events $A$, $B$, and $C$ to be **mutually independent**, we need:

1. **Pairwise Independence:**
   - $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$
   - $P(A \cap C) = P(A) \cdot P(C)$
   - $P(B \cap C) = P(B) \cdot P(C)$

2. **Triple Independence:**
   - $P(A \cap B \cap C) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \cdot P(C)$

**Important:** Pairwise independence does **not** imply mutual independence!

### Example: Pairwise Independent but Not Mutually Independent

Consider a fair die with:
- $A$ = $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$: $P(A) = \frac{2}{3}$
- $B$ = $\{1, 2, 5, 6\}$: $P(B) = \frac{2}{3}$
- $C$ = $\{1, 3, 5, 6\}$: $P(C) = \frac{2}{3}$

Check pairwise:
- $P(A \cap B) = P(\{1, 2\}) = \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3}$ ✓
- $P(A \cap C) = P(\{1, 3\}) = \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3}$ ✓
- $P(B \cap C) = P(\{1, 5, 6\}) = \frac{1}{2} \neq \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3}$ ✗

So they're not even pairwise independent, but this illustrates the concept.

## Financial Applications

### Portfolio Diversification

**Independent Assets:**
- If assets are independent, portfolio risk can be reduced through diversification
- $P(\text{All assets fail}) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(\text{Asset } i \text{ fails})$

**Dependent Assets:**
- Correlated assets increase portfolio risk
- $P(\text{All assets fail}) > \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(\text{Asset } i \text{ fails})$

### Market Regimes

**Example:** Market conditions create dependence
- $A$ = "Bull market": $P(A) = 0.6$
- $B$ = "High volatility": $P(B) = 0.3$
- If independent: $P(A \cap B) = 0.6 \cdot 0.3 = 0.18$
- In reality: $P(A \cap B) = 0.25$ (dependent - bull markets often have low volatility)

### Trading Signals

**Example:** Independent trading signals
- Signal 1 accuracy: $P(\text{Correct}) = 0.6$
- Signal 2 accuracy: $P(\text{Correct}) = 0.7$
- If independent: $P(\text{Both correct}) = 0.6 \cdot 0.7 = 0.42$
- If dependent: $P(\text{Both correct}) = 0.5$ (signals may be correlated)

## Python Implementation

```python
def are_independent(p_a, p_b, p_intersection, tolerance=1e-6):
    """
    Check if events A and B are independent
    
    Parameters:
    p_a: P(A)
    p_b: P(B)
    p_intersection: P(A ∩ B)
    tolerance: Numerical tolerance for comparison
    
    Returns:
    True if independent, False otherwise
    """
    expected = p_a * p_b
    return abs(p_intersection - expected) < tolerance

def conditional_probability(p_intersection, p_given):
    """
    Calculate conditional probability P(B | A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A)
    """
    if p_given == 0:
        return None  # Cannot condition on impossible event
    return p_intersection / p_given

# Example 1: Independent coin tosses
p_first_heads = 0.5
p_second_heads = 0.5
p_both_heads = 0.25

print(f"Are coin tosses independent? {are_independent(p_first_heads, p_second_heads, p_both_heads)}")

# Example 2: Dependent events (cards)
p_first_ace = 4/52
p_second_ace_given_first = 3/51
p_both_aces = p_first_ace * p_second_ace_given_first
p_second_ace_unconditional = 4/52

print(f"\nCard example:")
print(f"P(second ace | first ace) = {p_second_ace_given_first:.4f}")
print(f"P(second ace) = {p_second_ace_unconditional:.4f}")
print(f"Are dependent? {not are_independent(p_first_ace, p_second_ace_unconditional, p_both_aces)}")

# Example 3: Financial correlation
p_stock1_up = 0.6
p_stock2_up = 0.5
p_both_up_independent = 0.6 * 0.5  # If independent
p_both_up_correlated = 0.4  # Actual (correlated)

print(f"\nStock example:")
print(f"If independent: P(both up) = {p_both_up_independent:.2f}")
print(f"Actual (correlated): P(both up) = {p_both_up_correlated:.2f}")
print(f"Are independent? {are_independent(p_stock1_up, p_stock2_up, p_both_up_correlated)}")
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Assuming independence without verification**
   - In finance, events are often dependent (correlated)
   - Always check: $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$?

2. **Confusing independence with mutually exclusive**
   - **Independent**: $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$ (can both occur)
   - **Mutually Exclusive**: $P(A \cap B) = 0$ (cannot both occur)
   - These are different concepts!

3. **Assuming pairwise independence implies mutual independence**
   - Need to check all combinations for multiple events

## Key Takeaways

1. **Independence**: $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$ or equivalently $P(B | A) = P(B)$
2. **Dependence**: Events affect each other's probabilities
3. **Conditional Probability**: $P(B | A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$
4. **Financial Context**: Assets and events are often dependent (correlated)
5. **Mutual Independence**: Requires both pairwise and joint independence

## Next Steps

In the next chapter, we'll explore **conditional probability** in more depth, including [**Bayes' Theorem**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) and the [**Law of Total Probability**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_probability), which are essential tools for updating probabilities and making decisions under uncertainty.
