# 1.2 — Probability Axioms and Rules

Now that we understand sample spaces and events, we need a way to assign probabilities to events. This lesson introduces the **probability axioms** (fundamental rules that all probabilities must follow) and derived rules for calculating probabilities.

## What is Probability?

**Probability** is a number between 0 and 1 that quantifies how likely an event is to occur. Learn more: [Probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability)

- **0**: Impossible event (will never occur)
- **1**: Certain event (will always occur)
- **0.5**: Equally likely to occur or not occur

**Notation:** $P(A)$ denotes the probability of event $A$.

## The Three Probability Axioms

All probability theory is built on three fundamental axioms (rules that cannot be proven but are accepted as true). Learn more: [Probability Axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms)

### Axiom 1: Non-Negativity

For any event $A$, the probability is non-negative:

$$P(A) \geq 0$$

**Interpretation:** Probabilities cannot be negative.

### Axiom 2: Normalization

The probability of the sample space (certain event) is 1:

$$P(\Omega) = 1$$

**Interpretation:** Something must happen. The sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes is 1.

### Axiom 3: Additivity

For any collection of mutually exclusive events $A_1, A_2, A_3, ...$:

$$P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup ...) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + P(A_3) + ...$$

**Interpretation:** The probability of "A or B or C..." equals the sum of individual probabilities when events cannot occur simultaneously.

## Derived Probability Rules

From these three axioms, we can derive many useful rules:

### Rule 1: Complement Rule

The probability of the complement of event $A$ is:

$$P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$$

**Proof:** Since $A$ and $A^c$ are mutually exclusive and $A \cup A^c = \Omega$:
$$P(A) + P(A^c) = P(\Omega) = 1$$
Therefore: $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$

**Example:** If probability of rain is 0.3, then probability of no rain is $1 - 0.3 = 0.7$.

### Rule 2: Probability of Impossible Event

$$P(\emptyset) = 0$$

**Proof:** Since $\emptyset^c = \Omega$ and $P(\Omega) = 1$:
$$P(\emptyset) = 1 - P(\Omega) = 1 - 1 = 0$$

### Rule 3: Monotonicity

If event $A \subseteq B$, then:

$$P(A) \leq P(B)$$

**Interpretation:** If $A$ always implies $B$, then $A$ cannot be more probable than $B$.

**Example:** If $A$ = "Roll a 6" and $B$ = "Roll an even number", then $P(A) \leq P(B)$.

### Rule 4: Addition Rule (General Case)

For any two events $A$ and $B$:

$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$

**Why subtract?** When we add $P(A) + P(B)$, we count outcomes in $A \cap B$ twice, so we subtract once.

**Example:** 
- $A$ = "Roll an even number" = $\{2, 4, 6\}$, $P(A) = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5$
- $B$ = "Roll a number > 4" = $\{5, 6\}$, $P(B) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$
- $A \cap B$ = $\{6\}$, $P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{6}$
- $P(A \cup B) = 0.5 + \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$

### Rule 5: Addition Rule for Mutually Exclusive Events

If events $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive ($A \cap B = \emptyset$), then:

$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$$

This is a special case of Rule 4 where $P(A \cap B) = 0$.

## Equally Likely Outcomes

When all outcomes in a sample space are equally likely, we can use:

$$P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of outcomes in } A}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$$

### Examples

**Example 1: Fair Die**
- Sample space: $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ (6 equally likely outcomes)
- Event $A$ = "Roll a 6" = $\{6\}$
- $P(A) = \frac{1}{6}$

**Example 2: Even Number**
- Event $B$ = "Roll an even number" = $\{2, 4, 6\}$
- $P(B) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$

**Example 3: Card Draw**
- Drawing one card from a standard 52-card deck
- Event $A$ = "Draw an ace" = 4 aces
- $P(A) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}$

## Probability Bounds

From the axioms, we can show that for any event $A$:

$$0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$$

This follows from:
- Axiom 1: $P(A) \geq 0$
- Monotonicity: Since $A \subseteq \Omega$, we have $P(A) \leq P(\Omega) = 1$

## Financial Applications

### Portfolio Returns

**Example:** Portfolio can have three outcomes:
- High return: $P(\text{High}) = 0.3$
- Medium return: $P(\text{Medium}) = 0.5$
- Low return: $P(\text{Low}) = 0.2$

Check: $0.3 + 0.5 + 0.2 = 1.0$ ✓ (satisfies normalization)

**Question:** What's the probability of NOT getting a low return?
- $P(\text{Low}^c) = 1 - P(\text{Low}) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$

### Risk Events

**Example:** Two independent risk events:
- $A$ = "Market crash": $P(A) = 0.05$
- $B$ = "Liquidity crisis": $P(B) = 0.03$
- $A \cap B$ = "Both occur": $P(A \cap B) = 0.001$ (assumed)

**Question:** What's the probability of at least one risk event?
- $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = 0.05 + 0.03 - 0.001 = 0.079$

### Trading Outcomes

**Example:** Daily trading outcomes:
- Profit: $P(\text{Profit}) = 0.6$
- Loss: $P(\text{Loss}) = 0.3$
- Break-even: $P(\text{Break-even}) = 0.1$

Check: $0.6 + 0.3 + 0.1 = 1.0$ ✓

## Python Implementation

Let's implement probability calculations in Python:

```python
def probability_complement(p_a):
    """Calculate probability of complement event"""
    return 1 - p_a

def probability_union(p_a, p_b, p_intersection):
    """Calculate P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)"""
    return p_a + p_b - p_intersection

def probability_union_mutually_exclusive(p_a, p_b):
    """Calculate P(A ∪ B) when A and B are mutually exclusive"""
    return p_a + p_b

# Example: Die roll
p_even = 3/6  # Probability of even number
p_greater_4 = 2/6  # Probability of > 4
p_six = 1/6  # Probability of 6 (intersection)

# Probability of even OR > 4
p_even_or_greater_4 = probability_union(p_even, p_greater_4, p_six)
print(f"P(even OR > 4) = {p_even_or_greater_4:.3f}")

# Probability of NOT even
p_not_even = probability_complement(p_even)
print(f"P(not even) = {p_not_even:.3f}")

# Example: Mutually exclusive events
p_one = 1/6  # Probability of rolling 1
p_six = 1/6  # Probability of rolling 6
p_one_or_six = probability_union_mutually_exclusive(p_one, p_six)
print(f"P(1 OR 6) = {p_one_or_six:.3f}")
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Adding probabilities without checking for overlap**
   - Wrong: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$ (only true if mutually exclusive)
   - Right: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$

2. **Forgetting the complement rule**
   - Instead of calculating $P(A^c)$ directly, use $1 - P(A)$

3. **Assuming equally likely outcomes**
   - Only use $\frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$ when outcomes are equally likely
   - In finance, outcomes are rarely equally likely!

## Key Takeaways

1. **Three Axioms**: Non-negativity, Normalization, Additivity
2. **Complement Rule**: $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$
3. **Addition Rule**: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
4. **Mutually Exclusive**: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$ when $A \cap B = \emptyset$
5. **Equally Likely**: $P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$ when all outcomes are equally likely

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll explore **independence and dependence** between events, which is crucial for understanding relationships in financial data and risk analysis.
