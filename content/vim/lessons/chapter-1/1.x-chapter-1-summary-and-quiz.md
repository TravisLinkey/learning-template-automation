# 1.x — Chapter 1 Summary and Quiz

Let's review the four main Vim modes and test your understanding.

## Chapter Summary

### Lesson 1.1: Normal Mode — The Command Center

**Normal mode** is Vim's default mode where keystrokes execute commands.

**Key concepts:**
- You spend most of your time here
- Commands follow the grammar: `[count][operator][motion]`
- The `.` command repeats your last change

**Essential commands:**

| Category | Commands |
|----------|----------|
| Movement | `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `w`, `b`, `0`, `$` |
| Deletion | `x`, `dd`, `d{motion}` |
| Change | `c{motion}`, `cc` |
| Yank/Paste | `yy`, `y{motion}`, `p`, `P` |
| Undo/Redo | `u`, `Ctrl-r` |

### Lesson 1.2: Insert Mode — Entering Text

**Insert mode** is where you type text.

**Ways to enter Insert mode:**

| Command | Position |
|---------|----------|
| `i` / `a` | Before / after cursor |
| `I` / `A` | Start / end of line |
| `o` / `O` | New line below / above |
| `s` / `S` | Substitute character / line |
| `c{motion}` | Change (delete + insert) |

**Key techniques:**
- `Ctrl-o` executes one Normal command while staying in Insert mode
- Keep insertions atomic for better undo and dot command usage
- Exit with `Esc` or `Ctrl-[`

### Lesson 1.3: Visual Mode — Selecting Text

**Visual mode** lets you select text before operating on it.

**Three types:**

| Mode | Command | Selects |
|------|---------|---------|
| Character | `v` | Characters |
| Line | `V` | Entire lines |
| Block | `Ctrl-v` | Rectangular regions |

**Key techniques:**
- `gv` reselects last selection
- `o` toggles cursor between selection ends
- Text objects work: `viw`, `va"`, etc.
- Block mode enables column editing

### Lesson 1.4: Command-Line Mode — Ex Commands

**Command-line mode** provides Ex commands for file operations and more.

**Entry points:**
- `:` for Ex commands
- `/` for forward search
- `?` for backward search

**Essential commands:**

| Category | Commands |
|----------|----------|
| File | `:w`, `:q`, `:e`, `:wq` |
| Search | `/pattern`, `n`, `N`, `:noh` |
| Substitute | `:%s/old/new/g` |
| Global | `:g/pattern/command` |
| Settings | `:set option` |

## Mode Comparison

| Mode | Enter | Purpose | Exit |
|------|-------|---------|------|
| Normal | `Esc` | Navigate, command | — |
| Insert | `i`, `a`, `o`, etc. | Type text | `Esc` |
| Visual | `v`, `V`, `Ctrl-v` | Select text | `Esc` or operator |
| Command-line | `:`, `/`, `?` | Ex commands | `Enter` or `Esc` |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Normal mode is home base** — return here when not actively typing
2. **Each mode has a purpose** — use the right mode for the task
3. **Commands compose** — operators + motions = powerful combinations
4. **Visual mode previews** — see selection before acting
5. **Ex commands extend** — file ops, substitution, settings

## Quiz Time

Test your understanding of Vim modes.

**Question #1**

What is the difference between `i` and `a` when entering Insert mode?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

- `i` (insert) enters Insert mode with the cursor **before** the current character
- `a` (append) enters Insert mode with the cursor **after** the current character

Use `i` when you want to insert text at the cursor position. Use `a` when you want to add text after the current character.
</details>

**Question #2**

You want to delete three words starting from your cursor. What's the most efficient command?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

`d3w` — This uses the operator (`d` for delete), a count (`3`), and a motion (`w` for word).

Alternative: `3dw` also works (count before operator).
</details>

---

**Question #3**

What's the difference between `v`, `V`, and `Ctrl-v`?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

- `v` — **Character-wise** Visual mode: selects individual characters
- `V` — **Line-wise** Visual mode: selects entire lines
- `Ctrl-v` — **Block-wise** Visual mode: selects a rectangular block

Use `v` for selecting parts of lines, `V` for operating on whole lines, and `Ctrl-v` for column editing.
</details>

---

**Question #4**

How do you replace all occurrences of "foo" with "bar" in the entire file?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

```vim
:%s/foo/bar/g
```

- `%` — operate on all lines
- `s` — substitute command
- `/foo/bar/` — replace "foo" with "bar"
- `g` — global flag (all occurrences on each line)

Add `c` flag (`:%s/foo/bar/gc`) to confirm each replacement.
</details>

---

**Question #5**

You're in Insert mode and need to save the file without leaving Insert mode. How?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

Press `Ctrl-o` to execute one Normal mode command, then type `:w` and press Enter.

`Ctrl-o` temporarily switches to Normal mode for a single command, then returns to Insert mode.
</details>

---

**Question #6**

What does `gv` do and when would you use it?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

`gv` reselects the last visual selection.

Use it when:
- You need to perform another operation on the same selection
- You accidentally exited Visual mode before completing your action
- You want to adjust a selection you just made
</details>

---

**Question #7**

How do you add `//` to the beginning of lines 5-10 to comment them out?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

Method 1 (Block Visual):
1. `:5` to go to line 5
2. `Ctrl-v` to enter Block mode
3. `5j` to select down to line 10
4. `I` (capital I) to insert at start
5. Type `// `
6. Press `Esc`

Method 2 (Substitute):
```vim
:5,10s/^/\/\/ /
```
This substitutes the start of each line (`^`) with `// `.
</details>

---

**Question #8**

What's the difference between `dd` and `D`?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

- `dd` — Deletes the **entire current line**
- `D` — Deletes from the cursor to the **end of the line** (equivalent to `d$`)

Use `dd` to remove a whole line. Use `D` to delete only the remainder of a line.
</details>

---

**Question #9**

You have a word "hello" and want to change it to "world". Your cursor is on the 'h'. What are two ways to do this?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

1. `cw` then type "world" — Changes from cursor to end of word
2. `ciw` then type "world" — Changes the entire inner word regardless of cursor position

`ciw` is often preferred because it works no matter where in the word your cursor is positioned.
</details>

---

**Question #10**

How do you delete all blank lines in a file?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

```vim
:g/^$/d
```

- `:g` — Global command
- `/^$/` — Pattern matching empty lines (start of line immediately followed by end of line)
- `d` — Delete command

This executes the delete command on every line matching the pattern.
</details>
