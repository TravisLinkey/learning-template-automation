# 1.1 — Normal Mode — The Command Center

Normal mode is Vim's default mode and where you'll spend most of your time. Understanding Normal mode is the key to unlocking Vim's power.

## What is Normal Mode?

**Normal mode** is the command mode where keystrokes execute commands rather than inserting text. When you open Vim, you start in Normal mode.

Think of Normal mode as the "control room" of your editor:
- Every key is a command
- You navigate, delete, copy, paste, and manipulate text
- You issue commands to other modes

> **Key Insight**: In Vim, you spend more time editing existing text than writing new text. Normal mode optimizes for this reality.

## Recognizing Normal Mode

You're in Normal mode when:
- The cursor is a block (not a line)
- There's no mode indicator at the bottom, OR it shows `-- NORMAL --`
- Pressing letters doesn't type them on screen

If you're ever unsure what mode you're in, press `Esc` to return to Normal mode.

## Basic Normal Mode Commands

### Movement Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `h` | Move left |
| `j` | Move down |
| `k` | Move up |
| `l` | Move right |
| `w` | Move to next word |
| `b` | Move to previous word |
| `0` | Move to start of line |
| `$` | Move to end of line |

### Editing Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `x` | Delete character under cursor |
| `X` | Delete character before cursor |
| `dd` | Delete entire line |
| `D` | Delete from cursor to end of line |
| `yy` | Yank (copy) entire line |
| `p` | Paste after cursor |
| `P` | Paste before cursor |
| `u` | Undo |
| `Ctrl-r` | Redo |

### Entering Other Modes

| Command | Target Mode |
|---------|-------------|
| `i` | Insert mode (before cursor) |
| `a` | Insert mode (after cursor) |
| `v` | Visual mode (character) |
| `V` | Visual mode (line) |
| `:` | Command-line mode |
| `/` | Search forward |
| `?` | Search backward |

## The Philosophy of Normal Mode

### Commands are Composable

Normal mode commands follow a grammar: **[count][operator][motion]**

```
d       →  delete operator
w       →  word motion
dw      →  delete word
d3w     →  delete 3 words
```

This composability means learning a few operators and motions gives you many commands.

### The Dot Command

The `.` (dot) command repeats your last change. This is incredibly powerful:

1. `dw` — Delete a word
2. Move to another word
3. `.` — Delete that word too

The dot command makes Normal mode edits repeatable without macros.

### Counts Multiply Commands

Most commands accept a count prefix:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `5j` | Move down 5 lines |
| `3w` | Move forward 3 words |
| `2dd` | Delete 2 lines |
| `10x` | Delete 10 characters |

## Common Normal Mode Workflows

### Deleting Text

```
x       →  Delete single character
dw      →  Delete word (from cursor)
diw     →  Delete inner word (whole word)
dd      →  Delete line
d$      →  Delete to end of line
d0      →  Delete to start of line
```

### Changing Text

The `c` (change) operator deletes and enters Insert mode:

```
cw      →  Change word
ciw     →  Change inner word
cc      →  Change entire line
c$      →  Change to end of line
```

### Copying and Pasting

```
yy      →  Yank (copy) line
yw      →  Yank word
y$      →  Yank to end of line
p       →  Paste after cursor
P       →  Paste before cursor
```

## Returning to Normal Mode

From any mode, press `Esc` to return to Normal mode:

| From Mode | Key | Alternative |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| Insert | `Esc` | `Ctrl-[` |
| Visual | `Esc` | `Ctrl-[` |
| Command-line | `Esc` | `Ctrl-[` |

Many Vim users remap `Caps Lock` to `Esc` for easier access.

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Navigation
1. Open a file with multiple lines: `vim practice.txt`
2. Use `j` and `k` to move between lines
3. Use `h` and `l` to move within a line
4. Use `w` and `b` to move by words
5. Use `0` and `$` to jump to line boundaries

### Exercise 2: Deletion Practice
1. Position cursor on a character, press `x` to delete it
2. Position cursor on a word, press `dw` to delete it
3. Press `dd` to delete an entire line
4. Press `u` to undo each deletion

### Exercise 3: The Dot Command
1. Delete a word with `dw`
2. Move to another word with `w`
3. Press `.` to delete it
4. Repeat step 2-3 several times

### Exercise 4: Counts
1. Press `5j` to move down 5 lines
2. Press `3w` to move forward 3 words
3. Press `2dd` to delete 2 lines
4. Undo with `u`

## Common Mistakes

### Accidentally Typing in Normal Mode
If you start typing and see strange behavior (jumping around, deleting text), you're in Normal mode. Press `Esc`, then `u` to undo, then `i` to enter Insert mode.

### Forgetting Which Mode You're In
Always look at the bottom of the screen for mode indicators. When in doubt, press `Esc`.

### Using Arrow Keys
Arrow keys work but break the flow. Train yourself to use `hjkl` — it's faster once learned.

## Summary

| Concept | Key Points |
|---------|------------|
| **Normal Mode** | Default mode, commands not text |
| **Movement** | `hjkl`, `w`, `b`, `0`, `$` |
| **Operators** | `d` (delete), `c` (change), `y` (yank) |
| **Counts** | Prefix commands with numbers |
| **Dot Command** | `.` repeats last change |
| **Return to Normal** | `Esc` from any mode |

Normal mode is Vim's foundation. Master it, and every other mode becomes more powerful.
