# 1.2 — Insert Mode — Entering Text

Insert mode is where you actually type text, just like in any other editor. But Vim gives you multiple ways to enter Insert mode, each optimized for different situations.

## What is Insert Mode?

**Insert mode** is the mode where keystrokes insert characters into the buffer. It's the closest Vim gets to a "normal" text editor.

When you're in Insert mode:
- `-- INSERT --` appears at the bottom of the screen
- Characters you type appear in the document
- The cursor is typically a vertical line (depends on terminal)

## Ways to Enter Insert Mode

Vim provides many commands to enter Insert mode, each placing your cursor differently:

### Basic Insert Commands

| Command | Action | Mnemonic |
|---------|--------|----------|
| `i` | Insert before cursor | **i**nsert |
| `a` | Insert after cursor | **a**ppend |
| `I` | Insert at beginning of line | **I**nsert at start |
| `A` | Insert at end of line | **A**ppend to line |

### Opening New Lines

| Command | Action | Mnemonic |
|---------|--------|----------|
| `o` | Open line below, enter Insert | **o**pen below |
| `O` | Open line above, enter Insert | **O**pen above |

### Replacing Text

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `s` | Delete character, enter Insert (substitute) |
| `S` | Delete line, enter Insert (substitute line) |
| `c{motion}` | Delete motion, enter Insert (change) |
| `C` | Delete to end of line, enter Insert |

## Choosing the Right Entry Point

The key to efficient Vim usage is choosing the right command to enter Insert mode.

### Scenario: Add text at the end of a line

**Inefficient**: `$` then `a`  
**Efficient**: `A`

### Scenario: Add a new line of code below

**Inefficient**: `$` then `a` then `Enter`  
**Efficient**: `o`

### Scenario: Replace a word

**Inefficient**: `dw` then `i`  
**Efficient**: `cw` (or `ciw` for the whole word)

### Scenario: Fix a typo in the middle of a word

**Efficient**: Navigate to the character, press `s`, type the correction

## Insert Mode Commands

While in Insert mode, you have some special commands:

### Navigation (Limited)

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Arrow keys | Move cursor |
| `Ctrl-h` | Delete character before cursor (backspace) |
| `Ctrl-w` | Delete word before cursor |
| `Ctrl-u` | Delete to start of line |

### Special Insertions

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `Ctrl-r {reg}` | Insert contents of register |
| `Ctrl-r =` | Insert result of expression |
| `Ctrl-a` | Insert previously inserted text |
| `Ctrl-t` | Indent current line |
| `Ctrl-d` | Unindent current line |

### Exiting Insert Mode

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `Esc` | Return to Normal mode |
| `Ctrl-[` | Return to Normal mode (same as Esc) |
| `Ctrl-c` | Return to Normal mode (may skip abbreviations) |
| `Ctrl-o` | Execute one Normal mode command, return to Insert |

## The Ctrl-o Trick

`Ctrl-o` is incredibly useful. It lets you execute a single Normal mode command without leaving Insert mode.

**Example**: You're typing and need to save:
1. Press `Ctrl-o`
2. Type `:w` and press Enter
3. You're still in Insert mode!

**Example**: You're typing and need to scroll:
1. Press `Ctrl-o`
2. Press `Ctrl-d` to scroll down
3. Continue typing

## Insert Mode Best Practices

### Keep Insertions Atomic

Each time you enter Insert mode, make a single logical change, then return to Normal mode. This:
- Makes undo more useful (undo one logical change, not individual characters)
- Makes the dot command more powerful
- Keeps your edit history clean

**Bad**: Enter Insert mode, type a paragraph, make corrections, type more  
**Good**: Enter Insert mode, type a sentence, exit. Repeat.

### Use the Right Entry Command

Don't navigate in Insert mode. Instead:
1. Exit to Normal mode
2. Navigate to the new location
3. Enter Insert mode with the appropriate command

### Leverage Change Commands

The `c` (change) operator combines deletion with entering Insert mode:

```
ci"     →  Change inside quotes
ciw     →  Change inner word
ci(     →  Change inside parentheses
ct,     →  Change until comma
```

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Entry Points
1. Create a file with several lines of text
2. Practice using `i`, `a`, `I`, `A` to insert text at different positions
3. Use `o` and `O` to add new lines

### Exercise 2: The Change Operator
1. Write a sentence: `The quick brown fox`
2. Position on "quick", press `cw`, type "slow"
3. Position on "brown", press `ciw`, type "red"
4. Notice the difference between `cw` and `ciw`

### Exercise 3: Ctrl-o
1. Enter Insert mode and start typing
2. Press `Ctrl-o` then `0` to jump to line start (still in Insert mode)
3. Press `Ctrl-o` then `$` to jump to line end
4. Continue typing

### Exercise 4: Substitute Commands
1. Position cursor on a character
2. Press `s` and type a replacement
3. On a line, press `S` to replace the entire line

## Common Insert Mode Patterns

### Adding to End of Multiple Lines

1. `Ctrl-v` to enter Visual Block mode
2. Select the lines
3. `$` to extend to end of each line
4. `A` to append
5. Type your text
6. `Esc` — text appears on all lines

### Inserting the Same Text Multiple Times

Use a count before entering Insert mode:
1. `3i` — enter Insert mode with count 3
2. Type "hello "
3. `Esc` — "hello hello hello " appears

## Summary

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `i` / `a` | Insert before/after cursor |
| `I` / `A` | Insert at start/end of line |
| `o` / `O` | Open line below/above |
| `s` / `S` | Substitute character/line |
| `c{motion}` | Change (delete + insert) |
| `Esc` | Return to Normal mode |
| `Ctrl-o` | Execute one Normal command |

Remember: Insert mode is for inserting text. Everything else belongs in Normal mode.
