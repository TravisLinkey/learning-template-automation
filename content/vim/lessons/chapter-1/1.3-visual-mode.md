# 1.3 — Visual Mode — Selecting Text

Visual mode lets you select text and then operate on the selection. It bridges the gap between Vim's command-based approach and the familiar "select then act" paradigm.

## What is Visual Mode?

**Visual mode** allows you to visually select a region of text, then apply an operator to that selection. It's like highlighting text with your mouse, but using keyboard commands.

When you're in Visual mode:
- `-- VISUAL --`, `-- VISUAL LINE --`, or `-- VISUAL BLOCK --` appears at the bottom
- Selected text is highlighted
- Movement commands extend the selection

## Three Types of Visual Mode

Vim offers three visual selection modes:

| Mode | Command | Selects | Indicator |
|------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Character-wise** | `v` | Characters | `-- VISUAL --` |
| **Line-wise** | `V` | Entire lines | `-- VISUAL LINE --` |
| **Block-wise** | `Ctrl-v` | Rectangular block | `-- VISUAL BLOCK --` |

### Character-wise Visual Mode (`v`)

Selects individual characters. Use for selecting parts of lines.

```
This is [some text] to select
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
        Selected with v
```

### Line-wise Visual Mode (`V`)

Selects entire lines. Use for operating on multiple lines.

```
[First line of text     ]
[Second line of text    ]
[Third line of text     ]
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 Selected with V
```

### Block-wise Visual Mode (`Ctrl-v`)

Selects a rectangular block. Use for column editing.

```
Line one [text] here
Line two [text] here
Line thr [text] here
         ^^^^^^
         Selected with Ctrl-v
```

## Using Visual Mode

### Basic Workflow

1. Position cursor at selection start
2. Enter Visual mode (`v`, `V`, or `Ctrl-v`)
3. Move cursor to extend selection
4. Apply an operator

### Movement in Visual Mode

All Normal mode movements work in Visual mode:

| Command | Selection extends to... |
|---------|------------------------|
| `h/j/k/l` | Adjacent character/line |
| `w/b` | Next/previous word |
| `e` | End of word |
| `$` | End of line |
| `0` | Start of line |
| `gg` | Start of file |
| `G` | End of file |
| `}` | Next paragraph |
| `{` | Previous paragraph |

### Operators in Visual Mode

After selecting, apply an operator:

| Operator | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `d` or `x` | Delete selection |
| `c` | Change selection (delete + insert) |
| `y` | Yank (copy) selection |
| `>` | Indent selection |
| `<` | Unindent selection |
| `~` | Toggle case |
| `u` | Make lowercase |
| `U` | Make uppercase |
| `J` | Join lines |
| `:` | Enter command for selection |

## Visual Mode Techniques

### Reselecting the Last Selection

Press `gv` to reselect the last visual selection. Useful when you need to operate on the same region again.

### Switching Selection Modes

While in Visual mode, you can switch between modes:

| Current Mode | Press | New Mode |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| Character | `V` | Line |
| Character | `Ctrl-v` | Block |
| Line | `v` | Character |
| Line | `Ctrl-v` | Block |
| Block | `v` | Character |
| Block | `V` | Line |

### Adjusting Selection Boundaries

Press `o` to jump to the other end of the selection. This lets you adjust both boundaries.

```
[Selected text here]
^                  ^
Start              End (cursor)

Press 'o':

[Selected text here]
^                  ^
Cursor (start)     End
```

### Selecting with Text Objects

In Visual mode, you can use text objects to expand selection:

| Command | Selects |
|---------|---------|
| `aw` | A word (includes surrounding space) |
| `iw` | Inner word |
| `a"` | A quoted string (includes quotes) |
| `i"` | Inner quoted string |
| `a(` or `ab` | A parenthesized block |
| `i(` or `ib` | Inner parenthesized block |
| `a{` or `aB` | A braced block |
| `i{` or `iB` | Inner braced block |
| `at` | A tag block (HTML/XML) |
| `it` | Inner tag block |

## Block Visual Mode Power

Block mode (`Ctrl-v`) enables column-oriented editing:

### Insert at Start of Multiple Lines

1. `Ctrl-v` to enter Block mode
2. `j` to extend down multiple lines
3. `I` (capital I) to insert at start
4. Type your text
5. `Esc` — text appears on all lines

**Example**: Add `// ` to comment multiple lines:
```
line one          →    // line one
line two          →    // line two
line three        →    // line three
```

### Append at End of Multiple Lines

1. `Ctrl-v` to enter Block mode
2. `j` to extend down multiple lines
3. `$` to extend to end of each line
4. `A` to append
5. Type your text
6. `Esc` — text appears on all lines

### Delete a Column

1. `Ctrl-v` to enter Block mode
2. Move to select a column
3. `d` to delete

### Replace a Column

1. `Ctrl-v` to enter Block mode
2. Select the column
3. `c` to change
4. Type replacement
5. `Esc` — replacement appears on all lines

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Character Selection
1. Open a file with text
2. Press `v` to enter Visual mode
3. Use `w` to select words, `$` to select to end of line
4. Press `d` to delete the selection

### Exercise 2: Line Selection
1. Press `V` to enter Line Visual mode
2. Press `j` several times to select multiple lines
3. Press `>` to indent them
4. Press `gv` to reselect
5. Press `<` to unindent

### Exercise 3: Block Selection
1. Create several lines with similar structure
2. Press `Ctrl-v` to enter Block mode
3. Move to create a rectangular selection
4. Press `d` to delete the block
5. Undo with `u`

### Exercise 4: Multi-line Insert
1. Create several lines
2. `Ctrl-v`, then `j` several times
3. Press `I`, type `# `, press `Esc`
4. All lines now start with `# `

### Exercise 5: Text Objects in Visual
1. Position cursor inside a quoted string
2. Press `v` then `i"` to select inside quotes
3. Press `y` to yank
4. Move elsewhere and `p` to paste

## Visual Mode vs. Operators + Motions

Visual mode and Normal mode operators can often achieve the same result:

| Visual Mode | Normal Mode | Result |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| `viw` then `d` | `diw` | Delete inner word |
| `V` then `d` | `dd` | Delete line |
| `v$` then `y` | `y$` | Yank to end of line |

**When to use Visual mode:**
- You want to see what you're selecting before acting
- You're unsure of the exact motion
- You need to make adjustments to the selection
- Block operations

**When to use operators + motions:**
- You know exactly what you want
- Speed is important
- You want the operation to be repeatable with `.`

## Summary

| Mode | Command | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| Character | `v` | Select parts of lines |
| Line | `V` | Select whole lines |
| Block | `Ctrl-v` | Column editing |

| Technique | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Reselect last | `gv` |
| Switch ends | `o` |
| Exit | `Esc` |

Visual mode is your "preview before commit" tool. Use it when you want to see exactly what will be affected before taking action.
