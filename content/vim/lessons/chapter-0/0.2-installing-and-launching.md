# 0.2 — Installing and Launching Vim

Before we can start learning Vim, we need to have it installed on our system. In this lesson, we'll cover installation on major operating systems and how to launch Vim for the first time.

## Checking if Vim is Already Installed

Vim (or at least `vi`) is pre-installed on most Unix-like systems. Open your terminal and type:

```bash
vim --version
```

If Vim is installed, you'll see version information and a list of features. If not, you'll see a "command not found" error.

You can also check for the basic `vi` editor:

```bash
vi --version
```

## Installation by Operating System

### macOS

macOS comes with a basic version of Vim pre-installed. However, you may want a more feature-rich version:

**Using Homebrew (recommended):**
```bash
brew install vim
```

**For Neovim (modern fork):**
```bash
brew install neovim
```

After installation, you may need to restart your terminal or add the Homebrew bin to your PATH.

### Linux

Most Linux distributions include Vim, but you can install or upgrade it:

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install vim
```

**Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf install vim
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S vim
```

**For Neovim:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install neovim

# Fedora
sudo dnf install neovim

# Arch
sudo pacman -S neovim
```

### Windows

**Using Winget:**
```powershell
winget install vim.vim
```

**Using Chocolatey:**
```powershell
choco install vim
```

**Using Scoop:**
```powershell
scoop install vim
```

**Manual Installation:**
Download the installer from [vim.org/download](https://www.vim.org/download.php).

**For WSL users:**
If you use Windows Subsystem for Linux, follow the Linux instructions within your WSL distribution.

## Vim vs Neovim

You'll often hear about **Neovim** as an alternative to Vim. Here's a quick comparison:

| Feature | Vim | Neovim |
|---------|-----|--------|
| **Compatibility** | Original | 99% Vim-compatible |
| **Configuration** | Vimscript, Lua (9.0+) | Lua preferred |
| **Modern Features** | Available | Built-in LSP, Treesitter |
| **Community** | Mature, stable | Active, modern |

For this course, we'll focus on concepts that work in both. The commands and techniques you learn will transfer seamlessly between Vim and Neovim.

## Launching Vim

### Basic Launch

To launch Vim with an empty buffer:

```bash
vim
```

To open a specific file:

```bash
vim filename.txt
```

To open multiple files:

```bash
vim file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

### Launching Neovim

If you're using Neovim, replace `vim` with `nvim`:

```bash
nvim
nvim filename.txt
```

### Command-Line Options

Vim has many command-line options. Here are the most useful:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `vim filename` | Open a file |
| `vim +10 filename` | Open file and jump to line 10 |
| `vim +/pattern filename` | Open file and search for pattern |
| `vim -R filename` | Open file in read-only mode |
| `vim -d file1 file2` | Open files in diff mode |
| `vim -o file1 file2` | Open files in horizontal splits |
| `vim -O file1 file2` | Open files in vertical splits |

## Your First Vim Session

Let's launch Vim and understand what we see:

1. Open your terminal
2. Type `vim` and press Enter

You should see something like:

```
~
~
~                    VIM - Vi IMproved
~
~                    version 9.0
~                    by Bram Moolenaar et al.
~
~           Vim is open source and freely distributable
~
~                  type  :help iccf<Enter>       for information
~                  type  :q<Enter>               to exit
~                  type  :help<Enter>            for on-line help
~                  type  :help version9<Enter>   for version info
~
~
```

### Understanding the Screen

- **Tilde lines (~)**: Indicate lines beyond the end of the buffer (empty space)
- **Status line**: At the bottom, shows file info and cursor position
- **Command line**: The very bottom line where you type Ex commands

### Important: You're Now in Normal Mode

When Vim launches, you're in **Normal mode**. This is crucial to understand:

- Pressing letter keys does NOT type those letters
- Instead, letters trigger commands
- To type text, you must enter **Insert mode** first

Don't panic! In the next lesson, we'll cover the survival basics, including how to safely exit Vim.

## Getting Help

Vim has an extensive built-in help system:

```vim
:help           " Open help
:help topic     " Help on specific topic
:help :w        " Help on the :w command
:help i         " Help on the i command
:q              " Close help window
```

The help system uses hyperlinks—press `Ctrl-]` on a highlighted topic to jump to it, and `Ctrl-o` to jump back.

## Practice Exercise

1. Open your terminal
2. Check your Vim version: `vim --version`
3. Launch Vim: `vim`
4. Look at the welcome screen
5. Type `:q` and press Enter to exit

Congratulations! You've successfully launched and exited Vim. In the next lesson, we'll cover the essential survival commands you need to know.

## Summary

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Check Vim version | `vim --version` |
| Launch Vim | `vim` |
| Open a file | `vim filename` |
| Open file at line N | `vim +N filename` |
| Open help | `:help` |
| Exit Vim | `:q` |
