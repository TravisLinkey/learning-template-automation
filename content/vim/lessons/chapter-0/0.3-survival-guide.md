# 0.3 — Survival Guide — Basic Modes and Exiting

This lesson covers the absolute minimum you need to survive in Vim. By the end, you'll be able to open a file, make changes, save, and exit—without panic.

## The Most Important Thing: Modes

Vim is a **modal editor**. This is the key concept that confuses beginners:

- In most editors, pressing `j` types the letter "j"
- In Vim's **Normal mode**, pressing `j` moves the cursor down one line
- To type the letter "j", you must be in **Insert mode**

### The Three Modes You Need to Know Now

| Mode | Purpose | How to Enter | How to Exit |
|------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Normal** | Navigate, delete, copy, paste | Press `Esc` | Enter another mode |
| **Insert** | Type text | Press `i` | Press `Esc` |
| **Command-line** | Save, quit, search | Press `:` | Press `Esc` or Enter |

> **Rule #1**: When in doubt, press `Esc`. This returns you to Normal mode, which is the "safe" mode.

## Entering and Exiting Insert Mode

### Entering Insert Mode

From Normal mode, press `i` to enter Insert mode. You'll see `-- INSERT --` at the bottom of the screen.

Now you can type text normally. Press `Esc` to return to Normal mode.

There are several ways to enter Insert mode:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `i` | Insert before cursor |
| `I` | Insert at beginning of line |
| `a` | Append after cursor |
| `A` | Append at end of line |
| `o` | Open new line below |
| `O` | Open new line above |

For now, just remember `i` to insert and `Esc` to exit.

### The Escape Key

The `Esc` key is your friend. It:
- Returns you to Normal mode from any other mode
- Cancels partially-typed commands
- Dismisses error messages

Some people remap `Caps Lock` to `Esc` for easier access, or use `Ctrl-[` which is equivalent to `Esc`.

## Saving and Exiting

This is what everyone wants to know: **how do I exit Vim?**

### Basic Save and Exit Commands

From Normal mode, type these commands (they start with `:`):

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:w` | **W**rite (save) the file |
| `:q` | **Q**uit Vim |
| `:wq` | Write and quit (save and exit) |
| `:q!` | Quit without saving (discard changes) |
| `:wq!` | Write and quit, forcing if needed |
| `ZZ` | Save and quit (Normal mode shortcut) |
| `ZQ` | Quit without saving (Normal mode shortcut) |

### Step-by-Step: Edit, Save, and Exit

1. Open a file: `vim test.txt`
2. Press `i` to enter Insert mode
3. Type some text: "Hello, Vim!"
4. Press `Esc` to return to Normal mode
5. Type `:wq` and press Enter to save and exit

### When Vim Won't Let You Quit

If you see an error like:

```
E37: No write since last change (add ! to override)
```

This means you have unsaved changes. You can:
- `:w` to save, then `:q` to quit
- `:wq` to save and quit
- `:q!` to quit without saving (discarding changes)

## Basic Navigation

In Normal mode, use these keys to move around:

| Key | Movement |
|-----|----------|
| `h` | Left |
| `j` | Down |
| `k` | Up |
| `l` | Right |

Why `hjkl`? On the original keyboard Bill Joy used to create vi, these keys had arrow symbols on them. More importantly, they keep your fingers on the home row.

> **Tip**: Think of `j` as having a downward hook, pointing down.

### Alternative: Arrow Keys

Arrow keys also work in Vim, but experienced users avoid them because they require moving your hand from the home row. As you get comfortable, try to use `hjkl` instead.

## Basic Editing in Normal Mode

You don't need to be in Insert mode to delete text:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `x` | Delete character under cursor |
| `dd` | Delete entire line |
| `u` | Undo last change |
| `Ctrl-r` | Redo (undo the undo) |

### Undo is Your Safety Net

Made a mistake? Press `u` to undo. Vim has unlimited undo levels by default, so you can keep pressing `u` to go further back.

Undid too much? Press `Ctrl-r` to redo.

## Putting It All Together: Survival Workflow

Here's the minimal workflow for editing a file:

```
1. vim filename.txt          # Open file
2. i                         # Enter Insert mode
3. [type your changes]       # Edit text
4. Esc                       # Return to Normal mode
5. :wq                       # Save and quit
```

If something goes wrong:
```
Esc                          # Return to Normal mode
u                            # Undo if needed
:q!                          # Quit without saving if you want to start over
```

## Practice Exercise

Create and edit a test file:

1. Open terminal and run: `vim practice.txt`
2. Press `i` to enter Insert mode
3. Type: "This is my first Vim edit."
4. Press `Esc`
5. Press `o` to open a new line below and enter Insert mode
6. Type: "Learning Vim is fun!"
7. Press `Esc`
8. Type `:wq` and press Enter

Now reopen the file and make changes:

1. Run: `vim practice.txt`
2. Use `j` and `k` to move between lines
3. Press `dd` to delete a line
4. Press `u` to undo
5. Type `:q!` to quit without saving

## Quick Reference Card

Print this or keep it handy:

```
MODES
  i       Enter Insert mode
  Esc     Return to Normal mode
  :       Enter Command-line mode

SAVE & QUIT
  :w      Save
  :q      Quit
  :wq     Save and quit
  :q!     Quit without saving
  ZZ      Save and quit (shortcut)

NAVIGATION
  h j k l Left, Down, Up, Right

BASIC EDITING
  x       Delete character
  dd      Delete line
  u       Undo
  Ctrl-r  Redo

EMERGENCY
  Esc     Return to Normal mode (always safe)
  :q!     Abandon everything and exit
```

## Summary

You now know enough to survive in Vim:

1. **Modes matter**: Normal for commands, Insert for typing, Command-line for saving/quitting
2. **Esc is your friend**: Returns you to Normal mode from anywhere
3. **`:wq` saves and quits**: The most important command to remember
4. **`u` undoes mistakes**: Your safety net

In the next lesson, we'll review what we've learned and test your knowledge with a quiz. Then we'll dive deeper into Vim's modes and commands!
