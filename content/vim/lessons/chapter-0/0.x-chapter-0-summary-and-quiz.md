# 0.x — Chapter 0 Summary and Quiz

Let's review what we've learned in Chapter 0 and test your understanding with a quiz.

## Chapter Summary

### Lesson 0.1: Introduction to Vim

- **Vim** is a modal text editor that separates navigation from text entry
- The **Vim language** combines operators, motions, and text objects (e.g., `d2w` deletes 2 words)
- Vim's philosophy emphasizes:
  - **Composition**: Small commands combine into powerful operations
  - **Repeatability**: The `.` command and macros enable efficient repetitive edits
  - **Keyboard-centric**: Hands stay on the home row

### Lesson 0.2: Installing and Launching Vim

- Check if Vim is installed: `vim --version`
- Install via package managers:
  - macOS: `brew install vim`
  - Linux: `apt install vim`, `dnf install vim`, or `pacman -S vim`
  - Windows: `winget install vim.vim`
- **Neovim** is a modern fork that's 99% compatible with Vim
- Launch Vim: `vim` or `vim filename`
- Useful options: `vim +10 file` (open at line 10), `vim -O file1 file2` (vertical splits)

### Lesson 0.3: Survival Guide

**The Three Essential Modes:**

| Mode | Purpose | Enter | Exit |
|------|---------|-------|------|
| **Normal** | Navigate, manipulate | `Esc` | Enter another mode |
| **Insert** | Type text | `i`, `a`, `o` | `Esc` |
| **Command-line** | Ex commands | `:` | `Esc` or Enter |

**Save and Exit Commands:**

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:w` | Write (save) |
| `:q` | Quit |
| `:wq` | Write and quit |
| `:q!` | Quit without saving |
| `ZZ` | Save and quit (shortcut) |

**Basic Navigation:**

| Key | Movement |
|-----|----------|
| `h` | Left |
| `j` | Down |
| `k` | Up |
| `l` | Right |

**Basic Editing:**

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `x` | Delete character |
| `dd` | Delete line |
| `u` | Undo |
| `Ctrl-r` | Redo |

## Key Terms

- **Modal Editing**: A paradigm where different modes handle different tasks (navigation vs. text entry)
- **Normal Mode**: The default mode for navigating and executing commands
- **Insert Mode**: The mode for entering text
- **Command-line Mode**: The mode for executing Ex commands (`:w`, `:q`, etc.)
- **Buffer**: An in-memory representation of a file
- **Operator**: A command that performs an action (delete, change, yank)
- **Motion**: A command that moves the cursor

## Quiz Time

Test your understanding of Chapter 0 concepts.

**Question #1**

What is the key difference between Vim and traditional text editors?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

Vim is a **modal editor**. Unlike traditional editors where pressing a key always types that character, Vim has different modes for different purposes:
- **Normal mode**: Keys trigger commands (navigation, deletion, etc.)
- **Insert mode**: Keys type characters

This separation allows simple keystrokes to perform powerful operations without modifier keys.
</details>

---

**Question #2**

You've opened Vim and started typing, but instead of text appearing, the screen is doing strange things. What happened and how do you fix it?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

You're in **Normal mode**, where keystrokes are interpreted as commands, not text.

To fix:
1. Press `Esc` to ensure you're in Normal mode
2. Press `u` repeatedly to undo any unintended changes
3. Press `i` to enter Insert mode
4. Now you can type text normally
</details>

---

**Question #3**

How do you exit Vim without saving your changes? How do you exit while saving?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

**Exit without saving:**
- `:q!` (quit and discard changes)
- `ZQ` (Normal mode shortcut)

**Exit with saving:**
- `:wq` (write and quit)
- `:x` (write if modified, then quit)
- `ZZ` (Normal mode shortcut)
</details>

---

**Question #4**

What do the keys `h`, `j`, `k`, and `l` do in Normal mode? Why are these keys used instead of arrow keys?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

In Normal mode:
- `h` - Move left
- `j` - Move down
- `k` - Move up
- `l` - Move right

These keys are used because:
1. They keep your fingers on the **home row** of the keyboard
2. Historical reason: The original vi was created on a keyboard where these keys had arrow symbols
3. Efficiency: No need to move your hand to the arrow keys

Tip: Remember `j` points down (like a fishhook).
</details>

---

**Question #5**

You made several edits to a file and realize they were all wrong. What command undoes changes? What if you undo too much?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

**Undo:** Press `u` in Normal mode. Each press undoes one change. You can press multiple times to undo multiple changes.

**Redo (undo the undo):** Press `Ctrl-r` in Normal mode. This "redoes" changes you've undone.

Alternative: If you haven't saved, you can also use `:q!` to quit without saving and reopen the file to start fresh.
</details>

---

**Question #6**

Describe three different ways to enter Insert mode from Normal mode, and explain when you might use each.

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

1. **`i` (insert)**: Enter Insert mode before the cursor
   - Use when: You want to insert text at the current cursor position

2. **`a` (append)**: Enter Insert mode after the cursor
   - Use when: You want to add text immediately after the current character

3. **`o` (open)**: Open a new line below and enter Insert mode
   - Use when: You want to start typing on a new line

Other options include:
- `I`: Insert at the beginning of the line
- `A`: Append at the end of the line
- `O`: Open a new line above
</details>

---

**Question #7**

What happens if you try to quit Vim with `:q` when you have unsaved changes? What are your options?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

Vim will display an error:
```
E37: No write since last change (add ! to override)
```

Your options are:
1. **`:w`** then **`:q`** - Save the changes, then quit
2. **`:wq`** - Save and quit in one command
3. **`:q!`** - Quit without saving, discarding all changes

The `!` after `:q` forces Vim to quit despite unsaved changes.
</details>

---

**Question #8**

What is the command to delete the entire current line in Normal mode? What about deleting just the character under the cursor?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

- **`dd`** - Delete the entire current line
- **`x`** - Delete the character under the cursor

Both commands can be undone with `u`.

Note: `dd` is actually the delete operator `d` applied twice, which Vim interprets as "delete the current line."
</details>

## What's Next?

In Chapter 1, we'll dive deeper into Vim's modes, understanding:
- The nuances of Normal mode
- Different ways to enter Insert mode
- Visual mode for selection
- Command-line mode for powerful operations

You now have the survival skills to edit files in Vim without getting stuck. The next step is building efficiency and fluency with Vim's command language.
