# 2.4 — Screen and File Navigation

When working with large files, you need efficient ways to move beyond single lines. This lesson covers scrolling, screen positioning, and file-level navigation.

## File Navigation

### Jump to Line Numbers

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `gg` | Go to first line |
| `G` | Go to last line |
| `{n}G` | Go to line n |
| `{n}gg` | Go to line n |
| `:{n}` | Go to line n (command-line) |

### Jump by Percentage

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `50%` | Go to 50% of file |
| `25%` | Go to 25% of file |
| `75%` | Go to 75% of file |

### File Information

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `Ctrl-g` | Show file info and cursor position |
| `g Ctrl-g` | Detailed position info (columns, bytes, etc.) |

## Screen Navigation

### Cursor to Screen Position

| Command | Cursor moves to... |
|---------|-------------------|
| `H` | **H**igh — top of screen |
| `M` | **M**iddle of screen |
| `L` | **L**ow — bottom of screen |

These are extremely useful for quick jumps within the visible area.

**With counts:**
- `3H` — 3 lines from top of screen
- `5L` — 5 lines from bottom of screen

### Screen Scrolling

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `Ctrl-f` | Scroll **f**orward (down) one full screen |
| `Ctrl-b` | Scroll **b**ack (up) one full screen |
| `Ctrl-d` | Scroll **d**own half screen |
| `Ctrl-u` | Scroll **u**p half screen |
| `Ctrl-e` | Scroll down one line (cursor stays) |
| `Ctrl-y` | Scroll up one line (cursor stays) |

The half-screen scrolls (`Ctrl-d` and `Ctrl-u`) are often most useful because they maintain context.

## Repositioning the Screen

Sometimes you want to keep the cursor in place but reposition what's visible:

| Command | Screen positions so cursor is... |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| `zz` | Centered on screen |
| `zt` | At **t**op of screen |
| `zb` | At **b**ottom of screen |

**Use case**: You jump to a line and want to see context below it:
1. `42G` — jump to line 42
2. `zt` — put line 42 at top, see what follows

### With Line Start

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `z<Enter>` | Like `zt` but cursor at first non-blank |
| `z.` | Like `zz` but cursor at first non-blank |
| `z-` | Like `zb` but cursor at first non-blank |

## Paragraph and Section Movement

### Paragraphs

Paragraphs in Vim are separated by blank lines.

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `{` | Jump to previous blank line (paragraph start) |
| `}` | Jump to next blank line (paragraph end) |

### Sections

Sections are defined by `{` at the start of a line (common in C code).

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `[[` | Jump to previous section start |
| `]]` | Jump to next section start |
| `[]` | Jump to previous section end |
| `][` | Jump to next section end |

In practice, for most code, `{` and `}` (paragraph movement) are more useful.

## Sentence Movement

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `(` | Jump to previous sentence |
| `)` | Jump to next sentence |

A sentence ends with `.`, `!`, or `?` followed by whitespace.

## Matching Brackets

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `%` | Jump to matching bracket |

This works with `()`, `[]`, `{}`, and more.

**Example**:
```javascript
function test() {
    if (condition) {
        doSomething();
    }
}
```

With cursor on the first `{`, pressing `%` jumps to the matching `}`.

## Jump List Navigation

Vim maintains a **jump list** of significant cursor movements.

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `Ctrl-o` | Jump to **o**lder position |
| `Ctrl-i` | Jump to newer position |
| `:jumps` | Show jump list |

What counts as a "jump":
- `G`, `gg`, `{n}G`
- `%` (bracket matching)
- `(`, `)`, `{`, `}` (sentence/paragraph)
- `H`, `M`, `L`
- Search (`/`, `?`, `n`, `N`)
- Marks

What does NOT count as a jump:
- `j`, `k`, `h`, `l`
- `w`, `b`, `e`
- `f`, `t`, `F`, `T`

## Change List Navigation

Vim also tracks where you've made changes:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `g;` | Jump to previous change position |
| `g,` | Jump to next change position |
| `:changes` | Show change list |

Incredibly useful for returning to where you were editing.

## Practical Navigation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Quick File Overview
1. `gg` — go to start
2. `Ctrl-f` repeatedly — page through file
3. `G` — go to end
4. `Ctrl-b` repeatedly — page back

### Pattern 2: Jump to Function and Center
1. `/function_name` — search for function
2. `n` — find the match
3. `zz` — center it on screen

### Pattern 3: Edit, Check, Return
1. Make an edit
2. `G` — check end of file
3. `Ctrl-o` — return to where you edited

### Pattern 4: Navigate Large Function
1. Position on opening `{`
2. `%` — jump to closing `}`
3. `%` — jump back to opening `{`

### Pattern 5: Read Through Code
1. `{` or `}` — move by paragraph/function
2. `zz` — center current position
3. Repeat

## Configuring Scroll Behavior

### Scroll Offset

Keep cursor away from screen edges:
```vim
:set scrolloff=5     " Keep 5 lines visible above/below cursor
```

With `scrolloff=5`, scrolling happens before the cursor hits the edge, keeping context visible.

### Smooth Scrolling (Neovim)

Neovim supports smooth scrolling with plugins or built-in options.

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: File Jumps
1. Open a long file (100+ lines)
2. `gg` — go to start
3. `G` — go to end
4. `50%` — go to middle
5. `:75` — go to line 75
6. `Ctrl-o` — jump back

### Exercise 2: Screen Movement
1. Press `H` to go to screen top
2. Press `L` to go to screen bottom
3. Press `M` to go to screen middle
4. Note how the cursor moves

### Exercise 3: Scrolling
1. `Ctrl-d` — scroll down half screen
2. `Ctrl-u` — scroll up half screen
3. `Ctrl-f` — scroll full screen down
4. `Ctrl-b` — scroll full screen up
5. Feel the difference between half and full

### Exercise 4: Screen Repositioning
1. Go to any line in the middle of a file
2. `zt` — watch screen reposition (line at top)
3. `zz` — watch screen reposition (line centered)
4. `zb` — watch screen reposition (line at bottom)

### Exercise 5: Bracket Matching
1. Open a file with nested brackets
2. Position cursor on an opening `{`
3. Press `%` — jumps to matching `}`
4. Press `%` again — jumps back
5. Try with `(`, `[`, etc.

### Exercise 6: Paragraph Movement
1. Open a file with blank lines separating sections
2. `}` — jump to next blank line
3. `}` — jump again
4. `{` — jump back
5. Use this to navigate between functions

## Summary

| Category | Commands |
|----------|----------|
| **File** | `gg`, `G`, `{n}G`, `{n}%` |
| **Screen Position** | `H`, `M`, `L` |
| **Scrolling** | `Ctrl-f/b` (full), `Ctrl-d/u` (half), `Ctrl-e/y` (line) |
| **Reposition** | `zz` (center), `zt` (top), `zb` (bottom) |
| **Paragraph** | `{`, `}` |
| **Bracket** | `%` |
| **Jump List** | `Ctrl-o` (back), `Ctrl-i` (forward) |
| **Change List** | `g;` (back), `g,` (forward) |

With these commands, you can navigate any file efficiently, no matter how large.
