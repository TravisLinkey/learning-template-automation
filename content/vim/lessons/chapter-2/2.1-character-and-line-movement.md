# 2.1 — Character and Line Movement

Efficient navigation is the foundation of Vim productivity. In this lesson, we'll master the basic building blocks: character and line movement.

## The Home Row Movement Keys

Vim uses `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` for basic movement instead of arrow keys:

| Key | Direction | Mnemonic |
|-----|-----------|----------|
| `h` | Left | Leftmost key |
| `j` | Down | "Jump" down (or: j has a descender that points down) |
| `k` | Up | "Kick" up |
| `l` | Right | Rightmost key |

### Why Not Arrow Keys?

Arrow keys work in Vim, but using `hjkl` offers advantages:

1. **Speed**: Your hands never leave the home row
2. **Efficiency**: Less hand movement means faster editing
3. **Composability**: Works with counts and operators
4. **Availability**: Works in any terminal, even without arrow key support

> **Tip**: Force yourself to use `hjkl` for a week. It feels awkward at first, but becomes natural and faster.

## Using Counts with Movement

Every movement command accepts a count:

```
5j     →  Move down 5 lines
10k    →  Move up 10 lines
20l    →  Move right 20 characters
3h     →  Move left 3 characters
```

Counts transform simple movements into precise jumps.

### Relative Line Numbers

Enable relative line numbers to easily see jump distances:

```vim
:set relativenumber
```

Your screen shows:
```
  3│ three lines up
  2│ two lines up
  1│ one line up
  0│ current line (cursor here)
  1│ one line down
  2│ two lines down
  3│ three lines down
```

Now you can see "I need to go to the line marked 7" and type `7j`.

To show both absolute and relative:
```vim
:set number relativenumber
```

## Line-Based Movement

### Moving Within a Line

| Command | Moves to... |
|---------|-------------|
| `0` | First column (column 0) |
| `^` | First non-blank character |
| `$` | End of line |
| `g_` | Last non-blank character |

**Example line**: `    int x = 5;`
```
    int x = 5;
^   ^        ^
0   ^        $
```

- `0` goes to the very first column (the first space)
- `^` goes to the `i` in `int` (first non-blank)
- `$` goes to the `;` (end of line)

### Moving Vertically on Screen

| Command | Moves to... |
|---------|-------------|
| `+` or `Enter` | First non-blank of next line |
| `-` | First non-blank of previous line |
| `_` | First non-blank of current line (like `^`) |

## The `g` Prefix for Display Lines

When lines wrap on screen, Vim distinguishes between:
- **Real lines**: Lines in the file (separated by newlines)
- **Display lines**: Lines as shown on screen (wrapped portions)

| Command | Operates on... |
|---------|----------------|
| `j` / `k` | Real lines |
| `gj` / `gk` | Display lines |
| `0` / `$` | Real line boundaries |
| `g0` / `g$` | Display line boundaries |

If a long line wraps, `gj` moves down to the wrapped portion, while `j` skips to the next real line.

## Jumping to Specific Lines

### By Line Number

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:{n}` | Go to line n (Ex command) |
| `{n}G` | Go to line n (Normal mode) |
| `{n}gg` | Go to line n (Normal mode) |
| `gg` | Go to first line |
| `G` | Go to last line |

**Examples**:
```
:42     →  Go to line 42
42G     →  Go to line 42
42gg    →  Go to line 42
gg      →  Go to line 1
G       →  Go to last line
```

### By Percentage

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `50%` | Go to 50% through file |
| `25%` | Go to 25% through file |

## Column Movement

### Moving to a Specific Column

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `{n}|` | Go to column n |

**Example**: `20|` moves to column 20.

### Finding Characters in a Line

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `f{char}` | Find char forward (cursor on char) |
| `F{char}` | Find char backward (cursor on char) |
| `t{char}` | Find char forward (cursor before char) |
| `T{char}` | Find char backward (cursor after char) |
| `;` | Repeat last f/F/t/T |
| `,` | Repeat last f/F/t/T in opposite direction |

**Example**: In `function calculate(x, y)`
- `f(` — jump to the `(`
- `fx` — jump to `x`
- `;` — jump to next `x` (there isn't one, stays)
- `2f,` — jump to second comma (the `, y` part has it)

These are covered in depth in the next lesson, but they're essential for line movement.

## Returning to Previous Positions

Vim remembers where you've been:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `Ctrl-o` | Jump to previous position (older) |
| `Ctrl-i` | Jump to next position (newer) |
| ``` `` ``` | Jump to position before last jump |
| `''` | Jump to line of position before last jump |

The **jump list** stores significant movements. Use `Ctrl-o` repeatedly to retrace your steps.

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic hjkl
1. Open a file with multiple lines
2. Disable arrow keys mentally (or remap them to nothing)
3. Navigate using only `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`
4. Practice until it feels natural

### Exercise 2: Counts
1. Enable relative line numbers: `:set relativenumber`
2. Look at a line 7 lines below, press `7j`
3. Look at a line 4 lines above, press `4k`
4. Practice jumping to specific lines by their relative number

### Exercise 3: Line Boundaries
1. Go to a line with indentation
2. Press `0` to go to column 0
3. Press `^` to go to first non-blank
4. Press `$` to go to end of line
5. Press `g_` to go to last non-blank

### Exercise 4: Jump to Lines
1. Press `gg` to go to first line
2. Press `G` to go to last line
3. Press `50%` to go to middle
4. Type `:42` to go to line 42 (or any line)

### Exercise 5: Jump History
1. Navigate around the file with various jumps
2. Press `Ctrl-o` several times to go back
3. Press `Ctrl-i` to go forward again
4. Press ``` `` ``` to toggle between last two positions

## Common Patterns

### Editing the End of a Line
Instead of: `$` then `i` then arrow right  
Use: `A` (append at end of line)

### Going to a Specific Line to Edit
Instead of: Scrolling with `j` repeatedly  
Use: `42G` to jump directly to line 42

### Moving Relative to Current Line
Instead of: Counting lines manually  
Use: `:set relativenumber` and use the displayed numbers

## Summary

| Category | Commands |
|----------|----------|
| **Basic Movement** | `h` (left), `j` (down), `k` (up), `l` (right) |
| **Line Boundaries** | `0` (start), `^` (first char), `$` (end) |
| **Line Jumps** | `gg` (first), `G` (last), `{n}G` (line n) |
| **Display Lines** | `gj`, `gk`, `g0`, `g$` |
| **Jump History** | `Ctrl-o` (back), `Ctrl-i` (forward) |
| **Counts** | `{n}j`, `{n}k`, etc. |

Master these fundamentals, and you'll have a solid foundation for all Vim navigation.
