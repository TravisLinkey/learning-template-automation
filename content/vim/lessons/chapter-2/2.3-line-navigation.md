# 2.3 — Line Navigation

Efficient line navigation lets you jump directly to characters within a line. These commands are essential for precise, fast editing.

## Line Boundary Commands

### Start and End of Line

| Command | Moves to... |
|---------|-------------|
| `0` | Column 0 (absolute start) |
| `^` | First non-blank character |
| `$` | End of line |
| `g_` | Last non-blank character |

**Example line**: `    return result;  `
```
    return result;  
^   ^            ^  ^
0   ^            g_ $
```

### When to Use Each

- `0` — When you need column 0, even if it's whitespace
- `^` — When you want the first actual content (most common)
- `$` — When you want the absolute end of line
- `g_` — When you want the last actual content (ignoring trailing spaces)

## Find Commands: f, F, t, T

These are the most powerful line navigation commands.

### Find (f and F)

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `f{char}` | Find char forward, cursor **on** the character |
| `F{char}` | Find char backward, cursor **on** the character |

**Example**: `function calculate(x, y)`
```
function calculate(x, y)
^cursor

fc → function calculate(x, y)
           ^cursor on 'c'

f( → function calculate(x, y)
                       ^cursor on '('
```

### Till (t and T)

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `t{char}` | Find char forward, cursor **before** the character |
| `T{char}` | Find char backward, cursor **after** the character |

**Example**: `function calculate(x, y)`
```
function calculate(x, y)
^cursor

tc → function calculate(x, y)
          ^cursor before 'c'

t( → function calculate(x, y)
                      ^cursor before '('
```

### The Difference Matters for Operators

The choice between `f` and `t` matters when combined with operators:

```
delete_this_function(args)
^cursor

df( → (args)           # Deletes "delete_this_function("
dt( → delete_this_function(args)   # Deletes "delete_this_function"
                       ^cursor ends here
```

- `df(` deletes the `(` itself
- `dt(` deletes up to but not including `(`

## Repeating Find Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `;` | Repeat last f/F/t/T in same direction |
| `,` | Repeat last f/F/t/T in opposite direction |

**Example**: Finding all commas in `a, b, c, d, e`
```
a, b, c, d, e
^cursor

f,  →  a, b, c, d, e
        ^first comma

;   →  a, b, c, d, e
              ^second comma

;   →  a, b, c, d, e
                 ^third comma

,   →  a, b, c, d, e
              ^back to second comma
```

This is extremely useful for jumping through repeated characters like commas, parentheses, or quotes.

## Counts with Find Commands

All find commands accept counts:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `2f,` | Jump to second comma |
| `3fa` | Jump to third 'a' |
| `2T"` | Jump back to second-previous quote |

## Combining with Operators

Find commands become incredibly powerful with operators:

### Deleting

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `df,` | Delete through comma |
| `dt,` | Delete up to comma |
| `dF,` | Delete back through comma |
| `dT,` | Delete back to comma |

### Changing

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `cf)` | Change through closing paren |
| `ct"` | Change up to quote |
| `cT:` | Change back to colon |

### Yanking

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `yt,` | Yank up to comma |
| `yf;` | Yank through semicolon |

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Changing a Function Argument
```javascript
process(oldValue, secondArg, thirdArg)
        ^cursor
```

To change `oldValue` to `newValue`:
- `ct,` then type `newValue`

### Example 2: Deleting to End of Statement
```javascript
let result = calculateSum(a, b);
    ^cursor
```

To delete everything after `result`:
- `f=` then `D` (delete to end of line)
- OR `dt;` then `x` to also remove the semicolon

### Example 3: Navigating Quoted Strings
```python
message = "Hello, World!"
          ^cursor
```

To get inside the quotes:
- `f"` to go to first quote
- `l` to move inside
- OR `f"l` or better: `f"` then `ci"` to change inside

### Example 4: Working with Paths
```
/home/user/documents/project/file.txt
^cursor
```

To jump to specific parts:
- `f/;;` — jump to third `/` (documents)
- `t.` — jump to just before the `.`
- `f.l` — jump to the extension (`txt`)

## The `|` Command: Go to Column

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `{n}|` | Go to column n |

**Example**: `42|` goes to column 42. Useful for aligning or working with fixed-width data.

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Find Character
1. Create line: `function processData(input, output, flags)`
2. Press `f(` to jump to `(`
3. Press `fo` to jump to first `o` (in "output")
4. Press `;` to find next `o`
5. Press `,` to go back

### Exercise 2: Till Character
1. Create line: `let value = "Hello, World!";`
2. Press `t=` from start — where does cursor land?
3. Press `f=` from start — where does cursor land?
4. Note the difference

### Exercise 3: Delete with Find
1. Create: `remove, keep, this, text`
2. Position at start
3. `df,` — deletes "remove,"
4. Undo with `u`
5. `dt,` — deletes "remove" (keeps comma)

### Exercise 4: Multiple Finds
1. Create: `a, b, c, d, e, f, g`
2. `3f,` — jump to third comma
3. `,,` (comma twice) — go back two commas
4. `;;` — go forward two commas

### Exercise 5: Combined Editing
1. Create: `const name = "old value";`
2. Navigate to change "old value" using find commands
3. Try: `f"ci"` then type new value
4. This finds quote, then changes inside quotes

## Tips for Effective Line Navigation

### Choose the Right Command

| Situation | Best Command |
|-----------|--------------|
| Jump to a unique character | `f{char}` |
| Delete up to something | `dt{char}` |
| Delete through something | `df{char}` |
| Navigate repeated characters | `f{char}` then `;` |

### Think About Delimiters

Most code has natural delimiters: `(`, `)`, `,`, `.`, `"`, `'`, `:`, `;`

Learn to jump to these instantly:
- `f(` — function call
- `f"` — string start
- `f.` — method chain
- `f,` — next argument

### Use Count for Speed

If you see the third comma, don't do `f,;;`. Do `3f,`.

## Summary

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `0` / `^` / `$` | Line start / first char / end |
| `f{char}` | Find forward (on char) |
| `F{char}` | Find backward (on char) |
| `t{char}` | Till forward (before char) |
| `T{char}` | Till backward (after char) |
| `;` / `,` | Repeat find / reverse repeat |
| `{n}|` | Go to column n |

Line navigation commands are the key to surgical precision in Vim. Master `f`, `t`, and `;`, and you'll edit at the speed of thought.
