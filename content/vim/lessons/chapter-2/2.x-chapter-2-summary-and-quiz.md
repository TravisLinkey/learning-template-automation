# 2.x — Chapter 2 Summary and Quiz

Let's consolidate what we've learned about Vim navigation and test your understanding.

## Chapter Summary

### Lesson 2.1: Character and Line Movement

**Basic movement keys** (`hjkl`):

| Key | Direction |
|-----|-----------|
| `h` | Left |
| `j` | Down |
| `k` | Up |
| `l` | Right |

**Line boundaries:**

| Command | Position |
|---------|----------|
| `0` | Column 0 (absolute start) |
| `^` | First non-blank character |
| `$` | End of line |
| `g_` | Last non-blank character |

**Line jumps:**
- `gg` — first line
- `G` — last line
- `{n}G` or `:{n}` — go to line n

**Counts**: `5j` moves down 5 lines, `10l` moves right 10 characters

### Lesson 2.2: Word-Based Movement

**Two types of "words":**
- **word** (lowercase): separated by punctuation and whitespace
- **WORD** (uppercase): separated only by whitespace

| Motion | word | WORD |
|--------|------|------|
| Forward to start | `w` | `W` |
| Forward to end | `e` | `E` |
| Backward to start | `b` | `B` |
| Backward to end | `ge` | `gE` |

**With operators:**
- `dw` — delete word
- `ciw` — change inner word
- `yaw` — yank a word (with surrounding space)

### Lesson 2.3: Line Navigation

**Find and Till:**

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `f{char}` | Find forward (cursor ON char) |
| `F{char}` | Find backward (cursor ON char) |
| `t{char}` | Till forward (cursor BEFORE char) |
| `T{char}` | Till backward (cursor AFTER char) |
| `;` | Repeat last find |
| `,` | Repeat last find (reverse) |

**Key insight**: `df,` deletes through comma; `dt,` deletes up to comma.

### Lesson 2.4: Screen and File Navigation

**Screen position:**
- `H` — High (top of screen)
- `M` — Middle of screen
- `L` — Low (bottom of screen)

**Scrolling:**

| Command | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| `Ctrl-f` / `Ctrl-b` | Full screen |
| `Ctrl-d` / `Ctrl-u` | Half screen |
| `Ctrl-e` / `Ctrl-y` | Single line |

**Screen repositioning:**
- `zz` — center cursor on screen
- `zt` — cursor at top
- `zb` — cursor at bottom

**Paragraph/Section:**
- `{` / `}` — previous/next blank line
- `%` — matching bracket

**Jump history:**
- `Ctrl-o` — older position
- `Ctrl-i` — newer position

## Navigation Command Reference

| Category | Commands |
|----------|----------|
| **Basic** | `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` |
| **Words** | `w`, `b`, `e`, `W`, `B`, `E` |
| **Line Start/End** | `0`, `^`, `$`, `g_` |
| **Find** | `f`, `F`, `t`, `T`, `;`, `,` |
| **File** | `gg`, `G`, `{n}G` |
| **Screen** | `H`, `M`, `L` |
| **Scroll** | `Ctrl-f`, `Ctrl-b`, `Ctrl-d`, `Ctrl-u` |
| **Reposition** | `zz`, `zt`, `zb` |
| **Jumps** | `Ctrl-o`, `Ctrl-i`, `%`, `{`, `}` |

## Quiz Time

Test your navigation knowledge!

**Question #1**

What's the difference between `0` and `^`?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

- `0` — moves to column 0, the absolute start of the line (even if it's whitespace)
- `^` — moves to the first non-blank character on the line

**Example**: On line `    int x;`
- `0` moves to the first space
- `^` moves to the `i` in `int`
</details>

---

**Question #2**

You need to delete from your cursor to the end of the line. What command do you use?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

`D` or `d$`

Both delete from the cursor position to the end of the line. `D` is a shorthand for `d$`.
</details>

---

**Question #3**

What's the difference between `w` and `W`?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

- `w` — moves to start of next **word** (letters/digits/underscores OR sequences of other characters)
- `W` — moves to start of next **WORD** (any non-blank sequence)

**Example**: On `user.name = "value"`
- `w` from start stops at: `user`, `.`, `name`, `=`, `"`, `value`, `"`
- `W` from start stops at: `user.name`, `=`, `"value"`

Use `w` for fine-grained movement, `W` to skip over punctuation.
</details>

---

**Question #4**

How do you jump to line 42?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

Multiple ways:
- `42G` — Normal mode
- `42gg` — Normal mode
- `:42` — Command-line mode

All three take you to line 42.
</details>

---

**Question #5**

What's the difference between `f(` and `t(`?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

- `f(` — **F**ind the `(`, cursor lands **ON** the parenthesis
- `t(` — **T**ill the `(`, cursor lands **BEFORE** the parenthesis (on the character before it)

This matters with operators:
- `df(` deletes through the `(` (including it)
- `dt(` deletes up to the `(` (not including it)
</details>

---

**Question #6**

You're looking at the bottom of your screen and want to jump there quickly. What command?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

`L` — moves cursor to the **L**ow (bottom) of the visible screen.

Related commands:
- `H` — High (top) of screen
- `M` — Middle of screen
</details>

---

**Question #7**

What does `;` do and when would you use it?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

`;` repeats the last `f`, `F`, `t`, or `T` command in the same direction.

**Use case**: Finding all commas in a line:
1. `f,` — jump to first comma
2. `;` — jump to next comma
3. `;` — jump to next comma
4. `,` — (comma key) go back one if you went too far
</details>

---

**Question #8**

How do you scroll down half a screen?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

`Ctrl-d` — scrolls **d**own half a screen.

Related scrolling:
- `Ctrl-u` — up half screen
- `Ctrl-f` — down full screen
- `Ctrl-b` — up full screen
</details>

---

**Question #9**

You just made a jump to the end of the file with `G`. How do you get back to where you were?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

`Ctrl-o` — jump to **o**lder position in the jump list.

Vim maintains a jump list of significant movements. `Ctrl-o` goes back through this list.

Alternatively, ``` `` ``` (two backticks) jumps to the exact position before the last jump.
</details>

---

**Question #10**

You want to center the current line on your screen. What command?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

`zz` — repositions the screen so the current line is centered.

Related:
- `zt` — current line at **t**op of screen
- `zb` — current line at **b**ottom of screen
</details>

---

**Question #11**

You're on an opening brace `{` and want to jump to its matching closing brace. What command?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

`%` — jumps to the matching bracket.

Works with:
- `()` parentheses
- `[]` square brackets
- `{}` curly braces

Pressing `%` again returns to the original bracket.
</details>

---

**Question #12**

How do you delete from the cursor to the third comma on a line?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

`d3f,` or `3df,`

Both delete from cursor through the third comma:
- `d` — delete operator
- `3` — count
- `f,` — find comma motion

If you wanted to delete **up to** (not including) the third comma: `d3t,`
</details>

## What's Next?

In Chapter 3, we'll learn the heart of Vim's power: **Operators and Motions**. You'll understand:
- How operators and motions combine
- The full power of the dot command
- Advanced counts and repetition

This is where Vim starts to feel like a language you speak rather than commands you memorize!
