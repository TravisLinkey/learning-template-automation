# 2.2 — Word-Based Movement

Moving character by character is precise but slow. Word-based movement lets you jump through text much faster while maintaining precision.

## Words vs WORDs

Vim has two definitions of a "word":

### word (lowercase)
A sequence of letters, digits, and underscores, OR a sequence of other non-blank characters.

**Examples** of separate words:
```
hello         →  1 word
hello_world   →  1 word
hello-world   →  3 words (hello, -, world)
hello.world   →  3 words (hello, ., world)
$variable     →  2 words ($, variable)
```

### WORD (uppercase)
A sequence of non-blank characters separated by whitespace.

**Examples** of separate WORDs:
```
hello         →  1 WORD
hello_world   →  1 WORD
hello-world   →  1 WORD
hello.world   →  1 WORD
$variable     →  1 WORD
```

> **Think of it this way**: words respect punctuation; WORDs only care about spaces.

## Word Movement Commands

### Forward Movement

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `w` | Move to start of next word |
| `W` | Move to start of next WORD |
| `e` | Move to end of current/next word |
| `E` | Move to end of current/next WORD |

### Backward Movement

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `b` | Move to start of current/previous word |
| `B` | Move to start of current/previous WORD |
| `ge` | Move to end of previous word |
| `gE` | Move to end of previous WORD |

## Visualizing the Difference

Consider this line:
```
user.firstName = "John";
```

**Using `w` (word):**
```
user.firstName = "John";
^    ^         ^ ^     ^
w    w         w w     w
```
Stops at: `user`, `firstName`, `=`, `"John"`, `;`

**Using `W` (WORD):**
```
user.firstName = "John";
^              ^ ^
W              W W
```
Stops at: `user.firstName`, `=`, `"John";`

## Using Counts

All word motions accept counts:

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `3w` | Move forward 3 words |
| `2b` | Move back 2 words |
| `4W` | Move forward 4 WORDs |
| `2e` | Move to end of 2nd word ahead |

## Word Motions with Operators

Word motions combine powerfully with operators:

### Deleting Words

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `dw` | Delete from cursor to start of next word |
| `de` | Delete from cursor to end of word |
| `db` | Delete from cursor to start of word |
| `diw` | Delete entire word (cursor anywhere in word) |
| `daw` | Delete word plus surrounding space |

### Changing Words

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `cw` | Change from cursor to end of word |
| `ce` | Change from cursor to end of word (same as `cw`) |
| `ciw` | Change entire word |
| `caw` | Change word plus surrounding space |
| `cW` | Change from cursor to end of WORD |

### Yanking Words

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `yw` | Yank from cursor to start of next word |
| `yiw` | Yank entire word |
| `yaw` | Yank word plus surrounding space |

## The `iw` vs `aw` Distinction

When using text objects (covered in Chapter 4), there's an important difference:

- `iw` — **Inner word**: Just the word itself
- `aw` — **A word**: The word plus one side of surrounding whitespace

**Example**: In `hello world goodbye`
```
       ↓ cursor
hello world goodbye
      ^^^^^         iw selects "world"
      ^^^^^^        aw selects "world " (including trailing space)
```

This matters when deleting:
- `diw` on "world" leaves `hello  goodbye` (double space)
- `daw` on "world" leaves `hello goodbye` (clean)

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Navigating Code
```javascript
const calculateTotal = (items, taxRate) => {
```

From the start of the line:
- `w` → `calculateTotal`
- `w` → `=`
- `w` → `(`
- `w` → `items`
- `W` from start → `calculateTotal`
- `W` → `=`
- `W` → `(items,`

### Example 2: Editing a Variable Name
You want to change `oldName` to `newName`:
```
const oldName = "value";
      ^cursor
```
- `ciw` then type `newName`
- OR `cw` then type `newName` (if cursor at start of word)

### Example 3: Deleting a Method Call
```javascript
object.oldMethod().result
       ^cursor on 'o' of oldMethod
```
- `dW` deletes `oldMethod().result` (from cursor to space)
- `diw` deletes `oldMethod`
- `df)` deletes `oldMethod()` (using `f` from next lesson)

## When to Use word vs WORD

### Use `w`, `e`, `b` (word) when:
- Working with individual identifiers
- Editing within punctuated text
- You need fine-grained control

### Use `W`, `E`, `B` (WORD) when:
- Navigating quickly through code
- Skipping over punctuation-heavy sections
- Moving through URLs, paths, or compound expressions

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Word Navigation
1. Open a file with prose text
2. Press `w` repeatedly to move forward word by word
3. Press `b` repeatedly to move backward
4. Press `e` to move to word ends

### Exercise 2: word vs WORD
1. Create a line: `user.name = getData().value;`
2. Go to start of line with `0`
3. Press `w` repeatedly, note where it stops
4. Go back with `0`
5. Press `W` repeatedly, compare the stops

### Exercise 3: Counts with Words
1. Open any text file
2. Press `5w` to move forward 5 words
3. Press `3b` to move back 3 words
4. Press `2e` to move to 2nd word end ahead

### Exercise 4: Deleting Words
1. Create line: `delete this word here`
2. Position on "this"
3. Press `dw` — what happens?
4. Undo with `u`
5. Press `diw` — compare
6. Undo with `u`
7. Press `daw` — compare

### Exercise 5: Changing Words
1. Create line: `oldValue = calculate(oldInput)`
2. Navigate to `oldValue`
3. Press `ciw`, type `newValue`, press `Esc`
4. Navigate to `oldInput`
5. Press `ciw`, type `newInput`, press `Esc`

## Common Mistakes

### Using `dw` When You Mean `diw`
`dw` deletes from cursor to next word, which may leave partial words if cursor isn't at word start.

**Fix**: Use `diw` to delete the entire word regardless of cursor position.

### Forgetting `ge`
Many Vim users know `w`, `e`, `b` but forget `ge` (end of previous word).

**Use case**: You're at the start of a word and want to go to the end of the previous word.

### Over-using Character Movement
If you're pressing `l` many times to get to a word, you should use `w`, `e`, or `b` instead.

## Summary

| Motion | word (lowercase) | WORD (uppercase) |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Forward to start | `w` | `W` |
| Forward to end | `e` | `E` |
| Backward to start | `b` | `B` |
| Backward to end | `ge` | `gE` |

| With Operators | Command |
|----------------|---------|
| Delete word | `dw`, `diw`, `daw` |
| Change word | `cw`, `ciw`, `caw` |
| Yank word | `yw`, `yiw`, `yaw` |

Word-based navigation is a major upgrade from character movement. Master it, and you'll move through text significantly faster.
