# 0.2 — Prerequisites for Python Pandas

Before diving into pandas, let's review the essential Python concepts you'll need. This course assumes you have basic Python knowledge and focuses on pandas-specific features.

## Python Prerequisites

### Essential Python Skills

You should be comfortable with:

- **Variables and Data Types**: Integers, floats, strings, booleans
- **Lists and Dictionaries**: Understanding Python's basic data structures
- **Control Flow**: If/else statements, for loops, while loops
- **Functions**: Defining and calling functions
- **List Comprehensions**: Basic understanding (we'll use these)

### Object-Oriented Concepts

Helpful to understand:

- **Methods**: Calling methods on objects (e.g., `list.append()`)
- **Attributes**: Accessing object attributes (e.g., `obj.attribute`)
- **Classes**: Basic understanding (pandas DataFrames are objects)

## NumPy Basics (Helpful)

Pandas is built on NumPy, so understanding NumPy helps:

```python
import numpy as np

# Arrays
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Array operations
mean = arr.mean()
max_val = arr.max()
```

## What You Don't Need

This course is designed to be accessible:

- **No Advanced Python**: We'll cover pandas-specific features
- **No Deep NumPy**: Basic understanding is sufficient
- **No Statistics**: We focus on data manipulation, not analysis

## Data Concepts

Helpful to understand:

- **Tabular Data**: Understanding rows and columns
- **CSV Files**: Understanding comma-separated values
- **Time Series**: Understanding data over time (we'll cover this)

## Learning Approach

We'll use a hands-on, example-driven approach:

1. **Examples First**: We show working code examples
2. **Practice**: Hands-on exercises with real data
3. **Common Patterns**: We focus on frequently used operations
4. **Best Practices**: Tips for efficient and readable code

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll set up your Python environment and install pandas, then load your first dataset.
