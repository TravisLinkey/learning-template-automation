# 0.1 — Introduction to Networking for Quant Systems

Welcome to Learn Networking for Quant Systems! This tutorial series is designed to help you understand networking fundamentals, which are essential for quantitative finance since markets are networked systems.

## What is Networking?

**Computer networking** is the practice of interfacing two or more computing devices with each other for the purpose of sharing data. Learn more: [Computer Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network). In quantitative finance, networking is crucial for:

- **Market Data**: Receiving real-time market data feeds
- **Order Execution**: Sending orders to exchanges
- **Low Latency**: Minimizing network latency for HFT
- **System Architecture**: Understanding distributed systems
- **Infrastructure**: Understanding market infrastructure and connectivity

## Why Learn Networking for Quant Development?

As a quantitative developer, you'll work with:

1. **Protocols**: Understanding TCP vs UDP and when to use each
2. **Latency**: Understanding what causes network latency
3. **Throughput**: Balancing latency and throughput
4. **Serialization**: Understanding serialization overhead
5. **Low-Latency Networking**: Techniques for minimizing latency in HFT

## What You'll Learn

This tutorial series covers essential networking concepts:

### Transport Layer Protocols (Chapter 1)
- TCP vs UDP basics
- Latency/throughput tradeoffs
- When to use TCP vs UDP
- TCP congestion control

### Network Communication Fundamentals (Chapter 2)
- Packet lifecycle intuition
- Serialization overhead
- Queueing effects
- Network stack basics

### Low-Latency Networking (Chapter 3)
- Kernel bypass techniques
- User-space networking
- Zero-copy techniques
- Network programming for HFT

### Network Debugging and Monitoring (Chapter 4)
- Network debugging tools
- Latency measurement
- Network performance analysis

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have:

- **Programming Experience**: Familiarity with C++ or Python
- **Systems Knowledge**: Basic understanding of operating systems
- **Network Interest**: Interest in understanding how networks work

## Learning Approach

Each chapter combines theory with practical examples:

1. **Concepts**: We explain networking concepts clearly
2. **Examples**: We show code examples and network interactions
3. **Tools**: We demonstrate networking tools and debugging
4. **Performance**: We discuss latency and throughput considerations
5. **Practice**: Each chapter ends with exercises

## Goals

By the end of this tutorial series, you should be able to:

- Understand TCP vs UDP and choose appropriately
- Understand network latency and how to minimize it
- Understand serialization and its overhead
- Apply low-latency networking techniques
- Debug network issues
- Design network-aware systems for quant finance
