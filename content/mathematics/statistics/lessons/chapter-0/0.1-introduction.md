# 0.1 — Introduction to Applied Statistics for Quant Developers

Welcome to Learn Applied Statistics for Quant Developers! This tutorial series is designed to help you master practical statistical methods and their applications in quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, and data analysis.

## What is Applied Statistics?

**Applied statistics** is the practice of using statistical methods to analyze data, make inferences, and draw conclusions from real-world observations. Learn more: [Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics). Unlike theoretical probability (covered in our Quant Research course), applied statistics focuses on:

- **Data Analysis**: Extracting insights from real data
- **Statistical Inference**: Making conclusions about populations from samples
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Testing assumptions and making decisions
- **Regression Analysis**: Modeling relationships between variables
- **Experimental Design**: Planning studies to answer specific questions

## Why Learn Applied Statistics for Quant Development?

As a quantitative developer, you'll work with:

1. **Market Data Analysis**: Understanding price movements, volatility patterns, and market microstructure
2. **Model Validation**: Testing whether your models fit observed data
3. **Backtesting**: Evaluating trading strategies using historical data
4. **Risk Assessment**: Using statistical methods to quantify and manage risk
5. **Performance Metrics**: Analyzing returns, Sharpe ratios, and other performance indicators

## What You'll Learn

This tutorial series covers practical statistical methods:

### Statistical Inference (Chapters 1-2)
- Confidence intervals and point estimation
- Hypothesis testing and significance testing
- Type I and Type II errors
- Common test procedures

### Regression Analysis (Chapter 3)
- Linear regression for continuous outcomes
- Logistic regression for binary outcomes
- Time series regression
- Model diagnostics and validation

### Advanced Methods (Chapters 4-6)
- ANOVA and experimental design
- Sampling methods (bootstrap, resampling)
- Correlation vs causation pitfalls
- Practical statistical analysis

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have:

- **Probability Foundations**: Basic understanding of probability (covered in our Quant Research course)
- **Programming Experience**: Familiarity with Python (we'll use NumPy, SciPy, and pandas)
- **Basic Mathematics**: Comfort with algebra and basic calculus

## Learning Approach

Each chapter builds upon previous concepts:

1. **Theory First**: We explain statistical concepts clearly
2. **Intuition**: We provide intuitive explanations and real-world examples
3. **Code Examples**: We implement methods in Python with NumPy/SciPy
4. **Financial Applications**: We connect theory to quant finance use cases
5. **Practice**: Each chapter ends with a quiz to reinforce learning

## Goals

By the end of this tutorial series, you should be able to:

- Apply statistical inference methods to financial data
- Perform hypothesis tests and interpret results
- Build and validate regression models
- Understand correlation vs causation pitfalls
- Use statistical methods to analyze trading strategies
