# 1.x — Chapter 1 summary and quiz

## Chapter summary

This chapter covered the return and volatility concepts needed to compute backtest performance metrics.

### Key concepts

- **Simple return**: $(P_t - P_{t-1})/P_{t-1}$; in pandas, `pct_change()`.
- **Volatility**: standard deviation of returns; annualize with $\sigma_{\text{daily}} \sqrt{252}$ for daily data.
- **Annualized return**: scale mean daily return or total return to a yearly equivalent.
- **Sharpe ratio**: (annualized return − risk-free rate) / annualized volatility; risk-adjusted performance.

### What we learned

1. **1.1 Returns and volatility**: How to compute simple returns, total return, volatility, annualization, and a simple Sharpe ratio for use in [Project 1 — Backtesting Engine](/projects-01-backtester/lessons/0.1).

### Application

Use these definitions in your backtester to report total return, annualized return, annualized volatility, and Sharpe ratio. Combine with [Python & Pandas](/developer-python-pandas/) for data and [Quant Research](/quant/lessons/0.1) for interpreting results and risk.

## Quiz time

**Question 1**

What is the difference between simple return and log return? When might you use each?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

Simple return is $(P_t - P_{t-1})/P_{t-1}$; log return is $\ln(P_t/P_{t-1})$. For small returns they are close. Simple returns are intuitive and easy to compound over a few periods; log returns add over time (sum of log returns = log of total gross return) and are often used in models and for long-horizon aggregation.

**Question 2**

If daily returns have mean 0.0005 and standard deviation 0.01, what are (approximately) the annualized return and annualized volatility (252 trading days)?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

Annualized return (approximate): $(1 + 0.0005)^{252} - 1 \approx 0.134$ (about 13.4%). Annualized volatility: $0.01 \times \sqrt{252} \approx 0.159$ (about 15.9%).
</details>

**Question 3**

Why do we annualize returns and volatility when reporting backtest performance?

<details>
<summary>Show Solution</summary>

So we can compare strategies run over different lengths (e.g. 6 months vs. 2 years) and compare to benchmarks or risk-free rates quoted in annual terms. Annualization puts everything on a common scale (per year).
