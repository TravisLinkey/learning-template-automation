# 0.1 — Introduction to Linear Algebra for Quant Developers

Welcome to Learn Linear Algebra for Quant Developers! This tutorial series is designed to help you understand the linear algebra concepts needed to read, understand, and maintain quantitative model implementations.

## What is Linear Algebra?

**Linear algebra** is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations, linear functions, and their representations through matrices and vector spaces. Learn more: [Linear Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra). In quantitative finance, linear algebra is fundamental for:

- **Portfolio Theory**: Understanding portfolio optimization and risk models
- **Model Implementation**: Reading and understanding model code
- **Matrix Operations**: Working with covariance matrices, factor models
- **Optimization**: Understanding gradient-based optimization methods
- **Data Analysis**: Principal component analysis, factor analysis

## Why Learn Linear Algebra for Quant Development?

As a quantitative developer, you'll encounter linear algebra in:

1. **Model Code**: Many quant models use matrix operations and vector computations
2. **Portfolio Optimization**: Mean-variance optimization, risk models
3. **Factor Models**: Understanding factor exposures and risk decomposition
4. **Machine Learning**: Many ML algorithms use linear algebra (neural networks, PCA)
5. **Performance**: Understanding how matrix operations affect code performance

## What You'll Learn

This tutorial series covers essential linear algebra concepts:

### Vectors and Matrices (Chapter 1)
- Vector operations and properties
- Matrix representation and operations
- Matrix multiplication and its properties

### Matrix Operations (Chapter 2)
- Matrix inverses and determinants
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Matrix decompositions (LU, QR, SVD)

### Gradients and Optimization (Chapter 3)
- Gradient vectors and directional derivatives
- Optimization intuition
- Understanding gradient descent

### Understanding Model Code (Chapter 4)
- Reading quant model implementations
- Common patterns in quant code
- Matrix operations in practice

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have:

- **Basic Mathematics**: Comfort with algebra and basic calculus
- **Programming Experience**: Familiarity with Python (we'll use NumPy)
- **Quant Context**: Interest in quantitative finance (helpful for examples)

## Learning Approach

Each chapter focuses on practical understanding:

1. **Conceptual Foundation**: We explain linear algebra concepts clearly
2. **Intuition**: We provide geometric and intuitive explanations
3. **Code Examples**: We show implementations using NumPy
4. **Quant Applications**: We connect concepts to quant finance use cases
5. **Practice**: Each chapter ends with exercises

## Goals

By the end of this tutorial series, you should be able to:
