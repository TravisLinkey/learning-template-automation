# 0.2 — Prerequisites for Linear Algebra

Before diving into linear algebra, let's review the essential mathematical concepts you'll need. This course focuses on practical understanding for reading and maintaining quant code, so we'll emphasize intuition over rigorous proofs.

## Mathematical Prerequisites

### Basic Algebra

Essential skills:

- **Solving Equations**: Linear equations like $ax + b = c$
- **Systems of Equations**: Solving multiple equations simultaneously
- **Exponents**: Understanding $x^2$, $x^3$, etc.
- **Square Roots**: Understanding $\sqrt{x}$

### Basic Geometry

Helpful concepts:

- **Vectors in 2D/3D**: Understanding arrows in space (intuitively)
- **Coordinate Systems**: Understanding $(x, y)$ coordinates
- **Distance**: Understanding distance between points

### Basic Calculus (Helpful)

Some concepts will be easier with:

- **Derivatives**: Understanding rates of change
- **Partial Derivatives**: For multivariate functions
- **Gradients**: Understanding direction of steepest ascent

## Programming Prerequisites

### Python Basics

You should be comfortable with:

- **Variables and Data Types**: Basic Python types
- **Lists and Arrays**: Understanding sequences
- **Loops**: For iterating over data
- **Functions**: Defining and calling functions

### NumPy Basics

Essential for this course:

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating arrays
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Matrix operations
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
C = A @ B  # Matrix multiplication
```

## What You Don't Need

This course is designed to be accessible:

- **No Advanced Math**: We focus on practical understanding
- **No Proofs**: We emphasize intuition and application
- **No Deep Theory**: We focus on what you need for quant code

## Learning Approach

We'll use a practical, code-first approach:

1. **Intuition First**: We explain concepts intuitively
2. **Visual Examples**: We use geometric intuition
3. **Code Examples**: We show implementations in NumPy
4. **Quant Context**: We connect to quant finance applications

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll set up your Python environment and create your first linear algebra examples.
