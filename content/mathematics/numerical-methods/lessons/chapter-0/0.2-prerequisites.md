# 0.2 — Prerequisites for Numerical Methods

Before diving into numerical methods, let's review the essential mathematical and programming concepts you'll need. This course focuses on practical implementation, so we'll emphasize coding skills alongside mathematical understanding.

## Mathematical Prerequisites

### Calculus

Essential concepts:

- **Derivatives**: Understanding rates of change, chain rule
- **Partial Derivatives**: For multivariate functions
- **Integrals**: Definite and indefinite integrals
- **Taylor Series**: Understanding approximations (conceptually)

### Linear Algebra

You'll need:

- **Vectors and Matrices**: Basic operations
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Understanding how it works
- **Matrix Inverses**: Conceptually understanding inverses
- **Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors**: Basic understanding (we'll review)

**Note**: For a deeper dive, see our [Linear Algebra course](/mathematics-linear-algebra/).

### Basic Analysis

Understanding:

- **Limits**: Concept of convergence
- **Continuity**: Understanding continuous functions
- **Error Analysis**: Understanding approximation errors

## Programming Prerequisites

### Python Proficiency

You should be comfortable with:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes and methods
- **NumPy**: Array operations, broadcasting
- **SciPy**: Using scientific computing functions
- **Performance**: Understanding basic performance considerations

### C++ Basics (Optional but Helpful)

For performance sections:

- **Basic Syntax**: Variables, functions, classes
- **Memory Management**: Understanding stack vs heap
- **Compilation**: Basic understanding of compiling code

## Numerical Computing Concepts

### Floating Point Understanding

You should understand:

- **Precision**: That floating point has limited precision
- **Rounding Errors**: That calculations aren't exact
- **Overflow/Underflow**: What happens with very large/small numbers

### Algorithmic Thinking

Understanding:

- **Iterative Methods**: Solving problems through iteration
- **Convergence**: When iterative methods converge
- **Error Bounds**: Understanding approximation quality

## Software Tools

We'll use:

- **Python**: NumPy, SciPy, Numba (for JIT compilation)
- **C++**: For performance-critical examples (optional)
- **Profiling Tools**: cProfile, line_profiler
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib for plotting results

## What If You're Missing Prerequisites?

This course is designed to be practical:

1. **We'll Review**: Key mathematical concepts as needed
2. **Code-First**: We often show code first, then explain theory
3. **Examples**: Lots of working examples you can learn from
4. **Progressive**: Each chapter builds on previous concepts

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll set up your development environment and create your first numerical method implementation.
