# 0.1 — Introduction to Numerical Methods for Quant Developers

Welcome to Learn Numerical Methods for Quant Developers! This tutorial series is designed to help you understand and implement numerical algorithms for quantitative finance, with a focus on translating mathematical models into efficient, reliable code.

## What are Numerical Methods?

**Numerical methods** are algorithms for solving mathematical problems using numerical approximation rather than symbolic manipulation. Learn more: [Numerical Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis). In quantitative finance, numerical methods are essential for:

- **Model Implementation**: Translating mathematical models into code
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Generating random scenarios for pricing and risk analysis
- **Optimization**: Finding optimal parameters for models and strategies
- **Calibration**: Fitting models to market data
- **Performance**: Writing efficient numerical code for high-frequency applications

## Why Learn Numerical Methods for Quant Development?

As a quantitative developer, you'll work with:

1. **Floating Point Arithmetic**: Understanding precision, stability, and error accumulation
2. **Monte Carlo Methods**: Implementing simulations for option pricing and risk analysis
3. **Optimization Algorithms**: Calibrating models and optimizing trading strategies
4. **Performance Tuning**: Writing fast numerical code for real-time systems
5. **Numerical Libraries**: Using and understanding libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and custom implementations
